A TALE OF FLODDEN FIELD<br>

EDITOR&rsquo;S PREFACE.<br>
<br>
<br>
I. SCOTT AT ASHESTIEL.<br>
<br>
</b>Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s love of the country induced him, after
his marriage in 1797, to settle in a cottage at the pretty village of
Lasswade, near Edinburgh.&nbsp; Four years after leaving this district
he took Mr. Morritt of Rokeby to see the little dwelling, telling him
that, though not worth looking at, &lsquo;it was our first house when
newly married, and many a contrivance it had to make it comfortable.&rsquo;&nbsp;
He then enumerated various devices, by which he had secured for Mrs.
Scott and himself what seemed to both, at the time, additional convenience
and elegance in and about their home.&nbsp; His reminiscences culminated
in an account of an arch over the gate-way, which he had constructed
by fastening together the tops of two convenient willows and placing
above them &lsquo;a cross made of two sticks.&rsquo;&nbsp; This is very
beautiful and characteristic; and there is much freshness and charm
in the further picture of the young cottagers rejoicing over the success
of the arrangements.&nbsp; &lsquo;To be sure,&rsquo; Scott concluded,
&lsquo;it is not much of a lion to show a stranger; but I wanted to
see it again myself, for I assure you after I constructed it, Mamma
(Mrs. Scott) and I both of us thought it so fine, we turned out to see
it by moonlight, and walked backwards from it to the cottage-door in
admiration of our own magnificence and its picturesque effect.&rsquo;&nbsp;
It was his way to invest his circumstances with an interest over and
above what intrinsically belonged to them, and to prompt his friends
to a share in his delight.<br>
<br>
When, in 1804, Scott was appointed Sheriff of Selkirkshire, a condition
attaching to his post was that he should reside during part of the year
within the bounds of his sheriffdom.&nbsp; He then removed from Lasswade,
and settled at Ashestiel on the Tweed, seven miles from Selkirk.&nbsp;
This is his own account of the new home:--<br>
<br>
&lsquo;We found a delightful retirement, by my becoming the tenant of
my intimate friend and cousin-german, Colonel Russell, in his mansion
of Ashestiel, which was unoccupied during his absence on military service
in India.&nbsp; The house was adequate to our accommodation, and the
exercise of a limited hospitality.&nbsp; The situation is uncommonly
beautiful, by the side of a fine river, whose streams are there very
favourable for angling, surrounded by the remains of natural woods,
and by hills abounding in game.&nbsp; In point of society, according
to the heartfelt phrase of Scripture, we dwelt &ldquo;amongst our own
people&rdquo;; and as the distance from the metropolis was only thirty
miles, we were not out of reach of our Edinburgh friends, in which city
we spent the terms of the summer and winter Sessions of the Court, that
is, five or six months in the year.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
The functions of the Sheriff of Selkirkshire admitted of considerable
leisure, and Scott settled at Ashestiel full of literary projects, as
well as heartily prepared to meet his new responsibilities and to add
to his numerous and valuable friendships.&nbsp; An enterprise that early
engaged his attention was a complete edition of the British poets, but
the deliberations on the subject came to nothing except in so far as
they helped towards the preparation of Campbell&rsquo;s &lsquo;Specimens
of the British Poets,&rsquo; which appeared in 1819.&nbsp; Writing Scott
regarding his project of a complete edition of the poets, his friend
George Ellis said, &lsquo;Much as I wish for a corpus poetarum, edited
as you would edit it, I should like still better another Minstrel Lay
by the last and best Minstrel; and the general demand for the poem seems
to prove that the public are of my opinion.&rsquo;&nbsp; The work of
editing, however, he seemed at the time determined on having, and he
finally abandoned the idea of an exhaustive issue of the British poetry
previous to his own time and settled down to edit Dryden.&nbsp; This
was a work much needed, and Scott did it extremely well, as may be seen
by comparing his own issue of Dryden&rsquo;s Life and Works in 1808
with the recent reproduction of it, admirably edited by Mr. George Saintsbury.<br>
<br>
He had likewise, as he mentions in the General Preface to the Novels,
begun Waverley &lsquo;about 1805,&rsquo; and other literary engagements
received their share of attention.&nbsp; He wrote articles for the Edinburgh
Review, besides doing such minor if useful literary service as editing
for Constable &lsquo;Original Memoirs written during the Great Civil
Wars,&rsquo; and so on.&nbsp; At the same time, there were prospects
of professional advancement, an account of which he gives in the following
terms, in the 1830 Introduction to &lsquo;Marmion&rsquo;:--<br>
<br>
&lsquo;An important circumstance had, about the same time, taken place
in my life.&nbsp; Hopes had been held out to me from an influential
quarter, of a nature to relieve me from the anxiety which I must have
otherwise felt, as one upon the precarious tenure of whose own life
rested the principal prospects of his family, and especially as one
who had necessarily some dependence upon the favour of the public, which
is proverbially capricious; though it is but justice to add, that, in
my own case, I have not found it so.&nbsp; Mr. Pitt had expressed a
wish to my personal friend, the Right Hon. William Dundas, now Lord
Clerk Register of Scotland, that some fitting opportunity should be
taken to be of service to me; and as my views and wishes pointed to
a future rather than an immediate provision, an opportunity of accomplishing
this was soon found.&nbsp; One of the Principal Clerks of Session, as
they are called, (official persons who occupy an important and responsible
situation, and enjoy a considerable income,) who had served upwards
of thirty years, felt himself, from age, and the infirmity of deafness
with which it was accompanied, desirous of retiring from his official
situation.&nbsp; As the law then stood, such official persons were entitled
to bargain with their successors, either for a sum of money, which was
usually a considerable one, or for an interest in the emoluments of
the office during their life.&nbsp; My predecessor, whose services had
been unusually meritorious, stipulated for the emoluments of his office
during his life, while I should enjoy the survivorship, on the condition
that I discharged the duties of the office in the meantime.&nbsp; Mr.
Pitt, however, having died in the interval, his administration was dissolved,
and was succeeded by that known by the name of the Fox and Grenville
Ministry.&nbsp; My affair was so far completed, that my commission lay
in the office subscribed by his Majesty; but, from hurry or mistake,
the interest of my predecessor was not expressed in it, as had been
usual in such cases.&nbsp; Although, therefore, it only required payment
of the fees, I could not in honour take out the commission in the present
state, since, in the event of my dying before him, the gentleman whom
I succeeded must have lost the vested interest which he had stipulated
to retain.&nbsp; I had the honour of an interview with Earl Spencer
on the subject, and he, in the most handsome manner, gave directions
that the commission should issue as originally intended; adding, that
the matter having received the royal assent, he regarded only as a claim
of justice what he would have willingly done as an act of favour.&nbsp;
I never saw Mr. Fox on this, or on any other occasion, and never made
any application to him, conceiving that in doing so I might have been
supposed to express political opinions contrary to those which I had
always professed.&nbsp; In his private capacity, there is no man to
whom I would have been more proud to owe an obligation, had I been so
distinguished.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;By this arrangement I obtained the survivorship of an office,
the emoluments of which were fully adequate to my wishes; and as the
law respecting the mode of providing for superannuated officers was,
about five or six years after, altered from that which admitted the
arrangement of assistant and successor, my colleague very handsomely
took the opportunity of the alteration, to accept of the retiring annuity
provided in such cases, and admitted me to the full benefit of the office.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
At Ashestiel Scott systematically planned his day. He had his mornings
for his multifarious work, and the after part of the day was given to
necessary recreation and to his friends. He was an ardent member of
the Edinburgh Light Horse, at a time when volunteers of a practical
and energetic character seemed likely to be needed, and at Ashestiel
he combined a certain military routine with his legal and literary arrangements.
James Skene of Rubislaw, one of his best friends and most frequent visitors,
mentions that &lsquo;before beginning his desk-work in the morning he
uniformly visited his favourite steed, and neither <i>Captain</i> nor
<i>Lieutenant</i>, nor the <i>Lieutenant&rsquo;s</i> successor, <i>Brown
Adam</i> (so called after one of the heroes of the Minstrelsy), liked
to be fed except by him.&rsquo;&nbsp; Skene is the friend to whom Scott
addresses the Introduction to Canto IV, charged with touching and beautiful
reminiscences of earlier days.&nbsp; They were comrades in the Edinburgh
Light Horse Volunteers, Scott being Quartermaster and Skene Cornet.&nbsp;
Their friendship had been one of eleven years&rsquo; standing when the
dedicatory epistle was written:--<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Eleven years we now may tell,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we have known each other well;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since, riding side by side, our
hand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First drew the voluntary brand.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
With regard to the Introductions, it may now be said that they are better
where they are than if the poet had published them separately, as at
one time he seems to have intended (see Notes, p. 187).&nbsp; It is
sometimes said by those anxious to learn the story that these introductory
Epistles should be steadily ignored, and the cantos read in strict succession.&nbsp;
In answer to an assertion of opinion like this, it is hardly necessary
to say more than that probably those interested in the narrative alone
could not do better than avoid the Introductions.&nbsp; But it will
be well for them to miss various other things besides: will they, for
example, care for the impassioned address of Constance to her judges,
for the landlord&rsquo;s tale of grammarye, for Sir David Lyndsay&rsquo;s
narrative, or even for the many descriptive passages that interrupt
the free progress of the tale?&nbsp; Their reading would appear to be
done on the plan of those who get through novels, or other works of
imagination, by carefully omitting the dialogue and all those passages
in which the author pauses to describe or to reflect.&nbsp; It is needless
to say that this is not the spirit in which to approach &lsquo;Marmion&rsquo;
as it stands.&nbsp; Scott wrote with his friends about him, and it was
part of his own enjoyment of his work to interest them in what for the
time was receiving the main part of his attention.&nbsp; His talk with
Mr. Morritt in front of the little cottage at Lasswade is highly significant
as illustrative of his attitude towards his friends.&nbsp; His healthy,
humorous, happy nature wanted sympathy, appreciation, sociality, and
good cheer for its complete normal development, and this alone would
explain the writing of the Introductions.&nbsp; But there is more than
this.&nbsp; He talked over his subject and his progress with friends
competent to discuss and advise, and he showed them portions of the
poem as he advanced.&nbsp; There are indications in the Introductions
of certain discussions that had arisen over his conception and treatment,
and surely few readers would like to miss from the volume the clever
and humorous apology for his own method which the poet advances in the
Introduction to the third canto.&nbsp; William Erskine, refined critic
and life-long friend, is asked to be patient and generous while the
poet proceeds in his own way:--<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Still kind, as is thy wont, attend,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the minstrel spare the friend,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though wild as cloud, as stream,
as gale,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flow forth, flow unrestrain&rsquo;d,
my Tale!&rsquo;<br>
<br>
Further, the Introductions do not in any case interrupt the progress
of the Poem.&nbsp; Scott was dealing with a great national theme--a
cause he and his friends could understand and appreciate--and both before
starting and at every pause he has something to say that is apposite
and suggestive.&nbsp; His country&rsquo;s wintry state is the key-note
of the first Introduction, which is an appropriate prelude to a great
national tragedy; weird Border legends and the touching and mysterious
silences of lone St. Mary&rsquo;s Lake fitly introduce the &lsquo;mysterious
Man of Woe&rsquo;; the third and the fourth Introductions, with their
features of personal interest and their bright reminiscences of &lsquo;tales
that charmed&rsquo; and scenes on &lsquo;the field-day, or the drill,&rsquo;
are easily connected with the Hostel and the Camp; Spenser&rsquo;s &lsquo;wandering
Squire of Dames,&rsquo; the vigorous description of the &lsquo;Queen
of the North,&rsquo; and the tribute to the notes that &lsquo;Marie
translated, Blondel sung,&rsquo; all tell in their due place as preparatory
to the canto on The Court; while the ominous record, emanating from
a Yule-tide retreat, could not be more fitly interrupted than by a battle
of national disaster.&nbsp; Scott, then, may have thought of publishing
the Introductions separately, but it is well that he ultimately allowed
his better judgment to prevail.&nbsp; It is not necessary to dwell on
their special descriptive features, which readily assert themselves
and give Scott a high and honoured place among Nature-poets.&nbsp; His
quick and minute observation, his sense of colour and harmonious effects,
and his skill of arrangement are admirable throughout.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>II. COMPOSITION OF &lsquo;MARMION.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
</b>In 1791 Scott accompanied an uncle into Northumberland, and made
his first acquaintance with the scene of Flodden.&nbsp; Writing to his
friend William Clerk (Lockhart&rsquo;s Life, ii. 182), he says, &lsquo;Never
was an affair more completely bungled than that day&rsquo;s work was.&nbsp;
Suppose one army posted upon the face of a hill, and secured by high
grounds projecting on each flank, with the river Till in front, a deep
and still river, winding through a very extensive valley called Milfield
Plain, and the only passage over it by a narrow bridge, which the Scots
artillery, from the hill, could in a moment have demolished.&nbsp; Add
that the English must have hazarded a battle while their troops, which
were tumultuously levied, remained together; and that the Scots, behind
whom the country was open to Scotland, had nothing to do but to wait
for the attack as they were posted.&nbsp; Yet did two-thirds of the
army, actuated by the <i>perfervidum ingenium Scotorum</i>, rush down
and give an opportunity to Stanley to occupy the ground they had quitted,
by coming over the shoulder of the hill, while the other third, under
Lord Home, kept their ground, and having seen their King and about 10,000
of their countrymen cut to pieces, retired into Scotland without loss.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Fifteen years after this was written Scott began the composition of
&lsquo;Marmion,&rsquo; and it is interesting to note that, so early
in life as the date of this letter indicates, he was so keenly alive
to the great blunder in military tactics made by James IV and his advisers,
and so manifestly stirred to eloquent expression of his feeling.<br>
<br>
In November 1806 Scott began &lsquo;Marmion,&rsquo; designed as a romance
of Feudalism to succeed the Border study in &lsquo;The Lay of the Last
Minstrel.&rsquo;&nbsp; The circumstances of the time, no doubt, to some
extent prompted the choice of subject.&nbsp; Napoleon was diligently
working out his ambitious scheme of a Western Empire, and plotting the
ruin of Great Britain as an indispensable feature of the arrangement.&nbsp;
Scott was not always intimately acquainted with the details of current
politics, but when a subject fairly roused his interest he was not slow
to take part in its discussion.&nbsp; This is notably illustrated, in
this very year 1806, by the outspoken and energetic political ballad
he produced over the acquittal of Lord Melville from a serious charge.&nbsp;
This ballad, which went very straight to the heart of its subject, and
left no doubt as to the party feeling of the writer, not only arrested
general attention but gave considerable offence to the leaders on the
side so sharply handled.&nbsp; It is given, with an explanation of the
circumstances that called it forth, in Lockhart&rsquo;s Life, ii. 106,
1837 ed.<br>
<br>
While, however, party politics was not always a subject that interested
Scott, patriotism was a constituent element of his character.&nbsp;
He had a keen sense of national dignity and honour--as the extract from
his Flodden letter alone sufficiently testifies--and, had circumstances
demanded it of him, he would almost certainly have distinguished himself
as a trooper on the field of battle.&nbsp; Thus it was not only his
love of a picturesque theme that inspired him with his Tale of Flodden
Field, but likewise his patriotic ardour and his desire to touch the
national heart.&nbsp; &lsquo;Marmion&rsquo; is epical in character and
movement; and it is at the same time a brilliant and suggestive delineation
of a national effort, illustrating keen sense of honour, resolute purpose,
and pathetic manly devotion.&nbsp; James IV was probably wrong, and
he was certainly very rash, in attempting to do battle with Henry VIII,
but although his people were aware of his mistake, and his advisers
did all in their power to dissuade him, he was supported to the last
with a heroism that recalls Thermopylae.&nbsp; This was a display of
national character that appealed directly and powerfully to Scott, prompting
him to the production of his loftiest and most energetic verse.&nbsp;
Mournful associations will ever cluster around the tragic battle of
Flodden--that &lsquo;most dolent day,&rsquo; as Lyndsay aptly calls
it--but all the same the record remains of what heroic men had it in
them to do for King and country, where<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Groom fought like noble, squire
like knight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As fearlessly and well.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
Scott intended to work slowly and carefully through his new poem, but,
as he explains in the 1830 Introduction, circumstances interrupted his
design.&nbsp; &lsquo;Particular passages,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;of
a poem, which was finally called &ldquo;Marmion,&rdquo; were laboured
with a good deal of care, by one by whom much care was seldom bestowed.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The publication, however, was hastened by &lsquo;the misfortunes of
a near relation and friend.&rsquo;&nbsp; Lockhart (Life, ii. 115) explains
that the reference is to &lsquo;his brother Thomas&rsquo;s final withdrawal
from the profession of Writer to the Signet, which arrangement seems
to have been quite necessary towards the end of 1806.&rsquo;&nbsp; At
any rate, the poem was finished in a shorter time than had been at first
intended.&nbsp; The subject suited Scott so exactly that, even in default
of a special stimulus, there need be no surprise at the rapidity of
his composition after he had fairly begun to move forward with it.&nbsp;
Dryden, it may be remembered, was so held and fascinated by his &lsquo;Alexander&rsquo;s
Feast&rsquo; that he wrote it off in a night.&nbsp; Cowper had a similar
experience with &lsquo;John Gilpin,&rsquo; and Burns&rsquo;s powerful
dramatic tale, &lsquo;Tam O&rsquo;Shanter,&rsquo; was produced with
great ease and rapidity.&nbsp; De Quincey records that, in his own case,
his very best work was frequently done when he was writing against time.&nbsp;
Scott&rsquo;s energy and fluency of composition are clearly indicated
in the following passage in Lockharts Life, ii. 117:--<br>
<br>
&lsquo;When the theme was of a more stirring order, he enjoyed pursuing
it over brake and fell at the full speed of his <i>Lieutenant</i>.&nbsp;
I well remember his saying, as I rode with him across the hills from
Ashestiel to Newark one day in his declining years--&ldquo;Oh, man,
I had many a grand gallop among these braes when I was thinking of &lsquo;Marmion,&rsquo;
but a trotting canny pony must serve me now.&rdquo;&nbsp; His friend,
Mr. Skene, however, informs me that many of the more energetic descriptions,
and particularly that of the battle of Flodden, were struck out while
he was in quarters again with his cavalry, in the autumn of 1807.&nbsp;
&ldquo;In the intervals of drilling,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;Scott used
to delight in walking his powerful black steed up and down by himself
upon the Portobello sands, within the beating of the surge; and now
and then you would see him plunge in his spurs and go off as if at the
charge, with the spray dashing about him.&nbsp; As we rode back to Musselburgh,
he often came and placed himself beside me to repeat the verses that
he had been composing during these pauses of our exercise.&rdquo;&lsquo;<br>
<br>
This is wholly in keeping with the production of such poetry of movement
as that of &lsquo;Marmion,&rsquo; and it deserves its due place in estimating
the work of Scott, just as Wordsworth&rsquo;s staid and sober walks
around his garden, or among the hills by which he was surrounded, are
carefully considered in connexion with his deliberate, meditative verse.&nbsp;
Scott wrote the Introduction to Canto IV just a year after he had begun
the poem, and between that time and the middle of February 1808 the
work was finished.&nbsp; There is no rashness in saying that rapidity
of production did not detract from excellence of result.&nbsp; Indeed,
it is admiration rather than criticism that is challenged by the reflection
that, in these short months, the poet should have turned out so much
verse of high and enduring quality.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>III. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE POEM.<br>
<br>
</b>&lsquo;Marmion&rsquo; is avowedly a descriptive poem.&nbsp; It is
a series of skilful and impressive pictures, not only remarkable in
themselves, but conspicuous in their own kind in poetical literature.&nbsp;
Scott is said to have been deficient, or at any rate imperfectly trained,
in certain sense activities, but there is no denying his quick perception
of colour and his strong sense of the leading points in a landscape.&nbsp;
Even minute features are seized and utilized with ease and precision,
while the larger elements of a scene are depicted with breadth, sense
of proportion, and clearness and impressiveness of arrangement.&nbsp;
This holds true whether the description is merely a vivid presentment
of what the imagination of the poet calls from the remote past, or a
delineation of what has actually come under his notice.&nbsp; Norham
at twilight, with the solitary warder on the battlements, and Crichtoun
castle, as Scott himself saw it, instantly commend themselves by their
realistic vigour and their consistent verisimilitude.&nbsp; Any visitor
to Norham will still be able to imagine the stir and the imposing spectacle
described in the opening stanzas of the first canto; and it is a pleasure
to follow Scott&rsquo;s minute and faithful picture of Crichtoun by
examining the imposing ruin as it stands at the present day.&nbsp; Then
it is impossible not to feel that the Edinburgh of the sixteenth century
was exactly as it is depicted in the poem, and that the troops on the
Borough Moor were disposed as seen by the trained military eye of Sir
Walter Scott.&nbsp; It would be difficult to find anywhere a more striking
ancient stronghold than Tantallon, nor would it be easy to conceive
a more appropriate scene for that grim and exciting morning interview
in which the venerable Douglas found that he had harboured a recreant
knight.&nbsp; Above all, there is the great battle scene, standing alone
in literature for its carefully detailed delineation--its persistent
minuteness, its rapidity of movement, its balanced effects, its energetic
purpose--and surpassing everything in modern verse for its vivid Homeric
realism.&nbsp; Fifteen years before, as we have seen, Scott had the
progress of the battle in his mind&rsquo;s eye, and at length he produced
his description as if he had been present in the character of a skilful
and interested spectator.&nbsp; There are envious people who decline
to admit that Scott discovered his scenery, and who contend that others
knew all about it before and appreciated it in their own way.&nbsp;
Be it so; and yet the fact remains that Scott likewise saw and appreciated
in the way peculiar to him, and thereby enabled his numerous readers
to share his enjoyment.&nbsp; A very interesting and suggestive account
of the new popularity given to the Flodden district by the publication
of &lsquo;Marmion&rsquo; will be found in Lockhart&rsquo;s Life, iii.
12.&nbsp; In the autumn of 1812 Scott visited Rokeby, doing the journey
on horseback, along with his eldest boy and girl on ponies.&nbsp; The
following is an episode of the way:--<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Halting at Flodden to expound the field of battle to his young
folks, he found that &ldquo;Marmion&rdquo; had, as might have been expected,
benefited the keeper of the public-house there very largely; and the
village Boniface, overflowing with gratitude, expressed his anxiety
to have a <i>Scott&rsquo;s Head</i> for his sign-post.&nbsp; The poet
demurred to this proposal, and assured mine host that nothing could
be more appropriate than the portraiture of a foaming tankard, which
already surmounted his doorway.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, the painter man has
not made an ill job,&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;but I would fain
have something more connected with the book that has brought me so much
good custom.&rdquo;&nbsp; He produced a well-thumbed copy, and handing
it to the author, begged he would at least suggest a motto from the
Tale of Flodden Field.&nbsp; Scott opened the book at the death-scene
of the hero, and his eye was immediately caught by the &ldquo;inscription&rdquo;
in black letter:--<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Drink, weary pilgrim, drink, and
pray<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the kind soul of Sibyl Grey,&rdquo;
&amp;c.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well, my friend,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what more would you have?&nbsp;
You need but strike out one letter in the first of these lines, and
make your painter-man, the next time he comes this way, print between
the jolly tankard and your own name:--<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Drink, weary pilgrim, drink, and
PAY.&rsquo;&ldquo;<br>
<br>
Scott was delighted to find, on his return, that this suggestion had
been adopted, and for aught I know the romantic legend may still be
visible.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
The characters in the poem are hardly less vigorous in conception and
presentation than the descriptions.&nbsp; It may be true, as Carlyle
asserts in his ungenerous essay on Scott, that he was inferior to Shakespeare
in delineation of character, but, even admitting that, we shall still
have ample room for approval and admiration of his work.&nbsp; So far
as the purposes of the poem are concerned the various personages are
admirably utilized.&nbsp; We come to know Marmion himself very intimately,
the interest gradually deepening as the real character of the Palmer
and his relations to the hero are steadily developed.&nbsp; These two
take prominent rank with the imaginary characters of literature.&nbsp;
James IV, that &lsquo;champion of the dames,&rsquo; and likewise undoubted
military leader, is faithfully delineated in accordance with historical
records and contemporary estimates.&nbsp; Those desirous of seeing him
as he struck the imagination of a poet in his own day should read the
eulogy passed upon him by Barclay in his &lsquo;Ship of Fools.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The passage in which this occurs is an interpolation in the division
of the poem entitled &lsquo;Of the Ruine and Decay of the Holy Faith
Catholique.&rsquo;&nbsp; The other characters are all distinctly suited
to the parts they have to perform.&nbsp; Acting on the licence sanctioned
by Horatian authority:--<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Atque ita mentitur, sic veris falsa
remiscet,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Primo ne medium, medio ne discrepet
imum&rsquo;--<br>
<br>
Scott appropriates Sir David Lyndsay to his purpose, presenting him,
even as he presents the stately and venerable Angus, with faithful and
striking picturesqueness.&nbsp; Bishop Douglas is exactly suited to
his share in the development of events; and had room likewise been found
for the Court poet Dunbar--author of James&rsquo;s Epithalamium, the
&lsquo;Thrissill and the Rois&rsquo;--it would have been both a fit
and a seemly arrangement.&nbsp; Had Scott remembered that Dunbar was
a favourite of Queen Margaret&rsquo;s he might have introduced him into
an interesting episode.&nbsp; The passage devoted to the Queen herself
is exquisite and graceful, its restrained and effective pathos making
a singularly direct and significant appeal.&nbsp; The other female characters
are well conceived and sustained, while Constance in the Trial scene
reaches an imposing height of dramatic intensity.<br>
<br>
After the descriptions and the characterisation, the remaining important
features of the poem are its marked practical irony and its episodes.&nbsp;
Marmion, despite his many excellences, is throughout--and for obvious
reasons--the victim of a persistent Nemesis.&nbsp; Scott is much interested
in his hero; one fancies that if it were only possible he would in the
end extend his favour to him, and grant him absolution; but his sense
of artistic fitness prevails, and he will abate no jot of the painful
ordeal to which he feels bound to submit him.&nbsp; Marmion is a knight
with a claim to nothing more than the half of the proverbial qualifications.&nbsp;
He is <i>sans peur</i>, but not <i>sans reproche</i>; and it is one
expression of the practical irony that constantly lurks to assail him
that even his fearlessness quails for a time before the Phantom Knight
on Gifford Moor.&nbsp; The whole attitude of the Palmer is ironical;
and, after the bitter parting with Angus at Tantallon, Marmion is weighted
with the depressing reflection that numerous forces are conspiring against
him, and with the knowledge that it is his old rival De Wilton that
has thrown off the Palmer&rsquo;s disguise and preceded him to the scene
of war.&nbsp; In his last hour the practical irony of his position bears
upon him with a concentration of keen and bitter thrusts.&nbsp; Clare,
whom he intended to defraud, ministers to his last needs; he learns
that Constance died a bitter death at Lindisfarne; and just when he
recognises his greatest need of strength his life speedily ebbs away.&nbsp;
There is a certain grandeur of impressive tragical effort in his last
struggles, as he feels that whatever he may himself have been he suffers
in the end from the merciless machinery of a false ecclesiastical system.&nbsp;
The practical irony follows him even after his death, for it is a skilful
stroke that leaves his neglected remains on the field of battle and
places a nameless stranger in his stately tomb.<br>
<br>
As regards the episodes, it may just be said in a word that they are
appropriate, and instead of retarding the movement of the piece, as
has sometimes been alleged, they serve to give it breadth and massiveness
of effect.&nbsp; Of course, there will always be found those who think
them too long, just as there are those whose narrowness of view constrains
them to wish the Introductions away.&nbsp; If the poet&rsquo;s conception
of Marmion be fully considered, it will be seen that the Host&rsquo;s
Tale is an integral part of his purpose; and there is surely no need
to defend either Sir David Lyndsay&rsquo;s Tale or the weird display
at the cross of Edinburgh.&nbsp; The episode of Lady Heron&rsquo;s singing
carries its own defence in itself, seeing that the song of &lsquo;Lochinvar&rsquo;
holds a place of distinction among lyrics expressive of poetical motion.&nbsp;
After all, we must bear in mind that though it pleases Scott to speak
of his tale as flowing on &lsquo;wild as cloud, as stream, as gale,&rsquo;
he was still conscious that he was engaged upon a poem, and that a poem
is regulated by certain artistic laws.&nbsp; If we strive to grasp his
meaning we shall not be specially inclined to carp at his method.&nbsp;
It may at the same time be not unprofitable to look for a moment at
some of the notable criticisms of the poem.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>IV. CRITICISMS OF THE POEM.<br>
<br>
</b>When &lsquo;Marmion&rsquo; was little more than begun Scott&rsquo;s
publishers offered him a thousand pounds for the copyright, and as this
soon became known it naturally gave rise to varied comment.&nbsp; Lord
Byron thought it sufficient to warrant a gratuitous attack on the author
in his &lsquo;English Bards and Scotch Reviewers.&rsquo;&nbsp; This
is a portion of the passage:--<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;And think&rsquo;st thou, Scott!
by vain conceit perchance,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On public taste to foist thy stale
romance.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though Murray with his Miller may
combine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To yield thy muse just half-a-crown
per line?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No! when the sons of song descend
to trade,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their bays are sear, their former
laurels fade.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
As a matter of fact, there was on Scott&rsquo;s part no trade whatever
in the case.&nbsp; If a publisher chose to secure in advance what he
anticipated would be a profitable commodity, that was mainly the publisher&rsquo;s
affair, and the poet would have been a simpleton not to close with the
offer if he liked it.&nbsp; Scott admirably disposes of Byron as follows
in the 1830 Introduction:--<br>
<br>
&lsquo;The publishers of the &ldquo;Lay of the Last Minstrel,&rdquo;
emboldened by the success of that poem, willingly offered a thousand
pounds for &ldquo;Marmion.&rdquo;&nbsp; The transaction being no secret,
afforded Lord Byron, who was then at general war with all who blacked
paper, an apology for including me in his satire, entitled &ldquo;English
Bards and Scotch Reviewers.&rdquo;&nbsp; I never could conceive how
an arrangement between an author and his publishers, if satisfactory
to the persons concerned, could afford matter of censure to any third
party.&nbsp; I had taken no unusual or ungenerous means of enhancing
the value of my merchandise--I had never higgled a moment about the
bargain, but accepted at once what I considered the handsome offer of
my publishers.&nbsp; These gentlemen, at least, were not of opinion
that they had been taken advantage of in the transaction, which indeed
was one of their own framing; on the contrary, the sale of the Poem
was so far beyond their expectation, as to induce them to supply the
author&rsquo;s cellars with what is always an acceptable present to
a young Scottish housekeeper, namely, a hogshead of excellent claret.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
A second point on which Scott was attacked was the character of Marmion.&nbsp;
It was held that such a knight as he undoubtedly was should have been
incapable of forgery.&nbsp; Scott himself; of course, knew better than
his critics whether or not this was the case, but, with his usual good
nature and generous regard for the opinion of others, he admitted that
perhaps he had committed an artistic blunder.&nbsp; Dr. Leyden, in particular,
for whose judgment he had special respect, wrote him from India &lsquo;a
furious remonstrance on the subject.&rsquo; Fortunately, he made no
attempt to change what he had written, his main reason being that &lsquo;corrections,
however in themselves judicious, have a bad effect after publication.&rsquo;&nbsp;
He might have added that any modification of the hero&rsquo;s guilt
would have entirely altered the character of the poem, and might have
ruined it altogether.&nbsp; He had never, apparently, gone into the
question thoroughly after his first impressions of the type of knights
existing in feudal times, for though he states that &lsquo;similar instances
were found, and might be quoted,&rsquo; he is inclined to admit that
the attribution of forgery was a &lsquo;gross defect.&rsquo;&nbsp; Readers
interested in the subject will find by reference to Pike&rsquo;s &lsquo;History
of Crime,&rsquo; i. 276, that Scott was perfectly justified in his assumption
that a feudal knight was capable of forgery.&nbsp; Those who understand
how intimate his knowledge was of the period with which he was dealing
will, of course, be the readiest to believe him rather than his critics;
but when he seems doubtful of himself, and ready to yield the point,
it is well that the strength of his original position can thus be supported
by the results of recent investigation.<br>
<br>
Jeffrey, in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, not being able to understand
and appreciate this new devotion to romance, and probably stimulated
by his misreading of the reference to Fox in the Introduction to Canto
I, did his utmost to cast discredit on &lsquo;Marmion.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Scott was too large a man to confound the separate spheres of Politics
and Literature; whereas it was frequently the case with Jeffrey--as,
indeed, it was to some extent with literary critics on the other side
as well--to estimate an author&rsquo;s work in reference to the party
in the State to which he was known to belong.&nbsp; It was impossible
to deny merits to Scott&rsquo;s descriptions, and the extraordinary
energy of the most striking portions of the Poem, but Jeffrey groaned
over the inequalities he professed to discover, and lamented that the
poet should waste his strength on the unprofitable effort to resuscitate
an old-fashioned enthusiasm.&nbsp; They had been the best of friends
previously--and Scott, as we have seen, worked for the <i>Edinburgh
Review</i>--but it was now patent that the old literary intimacy could
not pleasantly continue.&nbsp; Nor is it surprising that Scott should
have felt that the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> had become too autocratic,
and that he should have given a helping hand towards the establishing
of the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, as a political and literary organ necessary
to the balance of parties.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>V. THE TEXT OF THE POEM.<br>
<br>
</b>Scott himself revised &lsquo;Marmion&rsquo; in 1831, and the interleaved
copy which he used formed the basis of the text given by Lockhart in
the uniform edition of the Poetical Works published in 1833.&nbsp; This
will remain the standard text.&nbsp; It is that which is followed in
the present volume, in which there will be found only three--in reality
only two--important instances of divergence from Lockhart&rsquo;s readings.&nbsp;
The earlier editions have been collated with that of 1833, and Mr. W.
J. Rolfe&rsquo;s careful and scholarly Boston edition has likewise been
consulted.&nbsp; It has not been considered necessary to follow Mr.
Rolfe in several alterations he has made on Lockhart; but he introduces
one emendation which readily commends itself to the reader&rsquo;s intelligence,
and it is adopted in the present volume.&nbsp; This is in the punctuation
of the opening lines in the first stanza of Canto II.&nbsp; Lockhart
completes a sentence at the end of the fifth line, whereas the sense
manifestly carries the period on to the eleventh line.&nbsp; In the
third Introd., line 228, the reading of the earlier editions is followed
in giving &lsquo;From me&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;For me,&rsquo; as
the meaning is thereby simplified and made more direct.&nbsp; In III.
xiv. 234, the modern versions of Lockhart&rsquo;s text give &lsquo;proudest
princes <i>veil</i> their eyes,&rsquo; where Lockhart himself agrees
with the earlier editions in reading &lsquo;<i>vail</i>&rsquo;.&nbsp;
The restoration of the latter form needs no defence.&nbsp; The Elizabethan
words in the Poem are not infrequent, giving it, as they do, a certain
air of archaic dignity, and there can be little doubt that &lsquo;vail&rsquo;
was Scott&rsquo;s word here, used in its Shakespearian sense of &lsquo;lower&rsquo;
or &lsquo;cast down,&rsquo; and recalling Venus as &lsquo;she vailed
her eyelids.&rsquo;<br>

<i>It is hardly to be expected, that an Author whom the Public have
honoured with some degree of applause, should not be again a trespasser
on their kindness.&nbsp; Yet the Author of MARMION must be supposed
to feel some anxiety concerning its success, since he is sensible that
he hazards, by this second intrusion, any reputation which his first
Poem may have procured him.&nbsp; The present story turns upon the private
adventures of a fictitious character; but is called a Tale of Flodden
Field, because the hero&rsquo;s fate is connected with that memorable
defeat, and the causes which led to it.&nbsp; The design of the Author
was, if possible, to apprize his readers, at the outset, of the date
of his Story, and to prepare them for the manners of the Age in which
it is laid.&nbsp; Any Historical Narrative, far more an attempt at Epic
composition, exceeded his plan of a Romantic Tale; yet he may be permitted
to hope, from the popularity of THE LAY OF THE LAST MINSTREL, that an
attempt to paint the manners of the feudal times, upon a broader scale,
and in the course of a more interesting story, will not be unacceptable
to the Public.<br>
<br>
The Poem opens about the commencement of August, and concludes with
the defeat of Flodden, 9th September, 1513.<br>

</i>November&rsquo;s sky is chill and drear,<br>
November&rsquo;s leaf is red and sear:<br>
Late, gazing down the steepy linn,<br>
That hems our little garden in,<br>
Low in its dark and narrow glen,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  5<br>
You scarce the rivulet might ken,<br>
So thick the tangled greenwood grew,<br>
So feeble trill&rsquo;d the streamlet through:<br>
Now, murmuring hoarse, and frequent seen<br>
Through bush and brier, no longer green,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 10<br>
An angry brook, it sweeps the glade,<br>
Brawls over rock and wild cascade,<br>
And, foaming brown with double speed,<br>
Hurries its waters to the Tweed.<br>
<br>
No longer Autumn&rsquo;s glowing red&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

Upon our Forest hills is shed;<br>
No more, beneath the evening beam,<br>
Fair Tweed reflects their purple gleam;<br>
Away hath pass&rsquo;d the heather-bell<br>
That bloom&rsquo;d so rich on Needpath-fell;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 20<br>
Sallow his brow, and russet bare<br>
Are now the sister-heights of Yair.<br>
The sheep, before the pinching heaven,<br>
To sheltered dale and down are driven,<br>
Where yet some faded herbage pines,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  25<br>
And yet a watery sunbeam shines:<br>
In meek despondency they eye<br>
The withered sward and wintry sky,<br>
And far beneath their summer hill,<br>
Stray sadly by Glenkinnon&rsquo;s rill:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  30<br>
The shepherd shifts his mantle&rsquo;s fold,<br>
And wraps him closer from the cold;<br>
His dogs no merry circles wheel,<br>
But, shivering, follow at his heel;<br>
A cowering glance they often cast,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 35<br>
As deeper moans the gathering blast.<br>
<br>
My imps, though hardy, bold, and wild,<br>
As best befits the mountain child,<br>
Feel the sad influence of the hour,<br>
And wail the daisy&rsquo;s vanish&rsquo;d flower;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  40<br>
Their summer gambols tell, and mourn,<br>
And anxious ask,-Will spring return,<br>
And birds and lambs again be gay,<br>
And blossoms clothe the hawthorn spray?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, prattlers, yes.&nbsp; The daisy&rsquo;s flower&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 45<br>
Again shall paint your summer bower;<br>
Again the hawthorn shall supply<br>
The garlands you delight to tie;<br>
The lambs upon the lea shall bound,<br>
The wild birds carol to the round,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 50<br>
And while you frolic light as they,<br>
Too short shall seem the summer day.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To mute and to material things<br>
New life revolving summer brings;<br>
The genial call dead Nature hears,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 55<br>
And in her glory reappears.<br>
But oh! my Country&rsquo;s wintry state<br>
What second spring shall renovate?<br>
What powerful call shall bid arise<br>
The buried warlike and the wise;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

The mind that thought for Britain&rsquo;s weal,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep graved in every British heart,<br>
O never let those names depart!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  70<br>
Say to your sons,-Lo, here his grave,<br>
Who victor died on Gadite wave;<br>
To him, as to the burning levin,<br>
Short, bright, resistless course was given.<br>
Where&rsquo;er his country&rsquo;s foes were found,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  75<br>
Was heard the fated thunder&rsquo;s sound,<br>

For Britain&rsquo;s sins, an early grave!<br>
His worth, who, in his mightiest hour,<br>
A bauble held the pride of power,<br>
Spum&rsquo;d at the sordid lust of pelf,<br>
And served his Albion for herself;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

A watchman on the lonely tower,<br>
Thy thrilling trump had roused the land,<br>
When fraud or danger were at hand;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  100<br>
By thee, as by the beacon-light,<br>
Our pilots had kept course aright;<br>
As some proud column, though alone,<br>
Thy strength had propp&rsquo;d the tottering throne:<br>
Now is the stately column broke,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  105<br>
The beacon-light is quench&rsquo;d in smoke,<br>
The trumpet&rsquo;s silver sound is still,<br>
The warder silent on the hill!<br>
<br>
Oh, think, how to his latest day,<br>
When Death, just hovering, claim&rsquo;d his prey,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  110<br>
With Palinure&rsquo;s unalter&rsquo;d mood,<br>
Firm at his dangerous post he stood;<br>
Each call for needful rest repell&rsquo;d,<br>
With dying hand the rudder held,<br>
Till, in his fall, with fateful sway,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 115<br>
The steerage of the realm gave way!<br>
Then, while on Britain&rsquo;s thousand plains,<br>
One unpolluted church remains,<br>
Whose peaceful bells ne&rsquo;er sent around<br>
The bloody tocsin&rsquo;s maddening sound,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  120<br>
But still, upon the hallow&rsquo;d day,<br>
Convoke the swains to praise and pray;<br>
While faith and civil peace are dear,<br>
Grace this cold marble with a tear,<br>
He, who preserved them, PITT, lies here!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor yet suppress the generous sigh,<br>
Because his rival slumbers nigh;<br>

And feelings keen, and fancy&rsquo;s glow,-<br>
They sleep with him who sleeps below:<br>
And, if thou mourn&rsquo;st they could not save<br>
From error him who owns this grave,<br>
Be every harsher thought suppress&rsquo;d,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  140<br>
And sacred be the last long rest.<br>
<i>Here</i>, where the end of earthly things<br>
Lays heroes, patriots, bards, and kings;<br>
Where stiff the hand, and still the tongue,<br>
Of those who fought, and spoke, and sung;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 145<br>
<i>Here</i>, where the fretted aisles prolong<br>
The distant notes of holy song,<br>
As if some angel spoke agen,<br>
&lsquo;All peace on earth, good-will to men;&rsquo;<br>
If ever from an English heart,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  150<br>
O, <i>here</i> let prejudice depart,<br>
And, partial feeling cast aside,<br>
Record, that Fox a Briton died!<br>
When Europe crouch&rsquo;d to France&rsquo;s yoke,<br>
And Austria bent, and Prussia broke,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

How high they soar&rsquo;d above the crowd!<br>

Jostling by dark intrigue for place;<br>
Like fabled Gods, their mighty war&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  170<br>
Shook realms and nations in its jar;<br>
Beneath each banner proud to stand,<br>
Look&rsquo;d up the noblest of the land,<br>
Till through the British world were known<br>
The names of PITT and Fox alone.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

And force the planets from the sky.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp;  180<br>
The wine of life is on the lees.<br>
Genius, and taste, and talent gone,<br>
For ever tomb&rsquo;d beneath the stone,<br>
Where-taming thought to human pride!-<br>
The mighty chiefs sleep side by side.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 185<br>
Drop upon Fox&rsquo;s grave the tear,<br>
&lsquo;Twill trickle to his rival&rsquo;s bier;<br>
O&rsquo;er PITT&rsquo;S the mournful requiem sound,<br>
And Fox&rsquo;s shall the notes rebound.<br>
The solemn echo seems to cry,-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 190<br>
&lsquo;Here let their discord with them die.<br>

Then, O, how impotent and vain&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  200<br>
This grateful tributary strain!<br>
Though not unmark&rsquo;d from northern clime,<br>
Ye heard the Border Minstrel&rsquo;s rhyme:<br>
His Gothic harp has o&rsquo;er you rung;<br>
The Bard you deign&rsquo;d to praise, your deathless names has sung.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Stay yet, illusion, stay a while,<br>
My wilder&rsquo;d fancy still beguile!<br>
From this high theme how can I part,<br>
Ere half unloaded is my heart!<br>
For all the tears e&rsquo;er sorrow drew,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 210<br>
And all the raptures fancy knew,<br>
And all the keener rush of blood,<br>
That throbs through bard in bard-like mood,<br>
Were here a tribute mean and low,<br>
Though all their mingled streams could flow-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 215<br>
Woe, wonder, and sensation high,<br>
In one spring-tide of ecstasy!-<br>
It will not be-it may not last-<br>
The vision of enchantment&rsquo;s past:<br>
Like frostwork in the morning ray,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  220<br>
The fancied fabric melts away;<br>
Each Gothic arch, memorial-stone,<br>
And long, dim, lofty aisle, are gone;<br>
And, lingering last, deception dear,<br>
The choir&rsquo;s high sounds die on my ear.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  225<br>
Now slow return the lonely down,<br>
The silent pastures bleak and brown,<br>
The farm begirt with copsewood wild<br>
The gambols of each frolic child,<br>
Mixing their shrill cries with the tone&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 230<br>
Of Tweed&rsquo;s dark waters rushing on.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Prompt on unequal tasks to run,<br>
Thus Nature disciplines her son:<br>
Meeter, she says, for me to stray,<br>
And waste the solitary day,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
235<br>
In plucking from yon fen the reed,<br>
And watch it floating down the Tweed;<br>
Or idly list the shrilling lay,<br>
With which the milkmaid cheers her way,<br>
Marking its cadence rise and fail,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  240<br>
As from the field, beneath her pail,<br>
She trips it down the uneven dale:<br>
Meeter for me, by yonder cairn,<br>
The ancient shepherd&rsquo;s tale to learn;<br>
Though oft he stop in rustic fear,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  245<br>
Lest his old legends tire the ear<br>
Of one, who, in his simple mind,<br>
May boast of book-learn&rsquo;d taste refined.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But thou, my friend, canst fitly tell,<br>
(For few have read romance so well,)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  250<br>
How still the legendary lay<br>
O&rsquo;er poet&rsquo;s bosom holds its sway;<br>
How on the ancient minstrel strain<br>
Time lays his palsied hand in vain;<br>
And how our hearts at doughty deeds,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  255<br>
By warriors wrought in steely weeds,<br>
Still throb for fear and pity&rsquo;s sake;<br>
As when the Champion of the Lake<br>
Enters Morgana&rsquo;s fated house,<br>
Or in the Chapel Perilous,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 260<br>
Despising spells and demons&rsquo; force,<br>
Holds converse with the unburied corse;<br>
Or when, Dame Ganore&rsquo;s grace to move,<br>
(Alas, that lawless was their love!)<br>
He sought proud Tarquin in his den,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 265<br>
And freed full sixty knights; or when,<br>
A sinful man, and unconfess&rsquo;d,<br>
He took the Sangreal&rsquo;s holy quest,<br>
And, slumbering, saw the vision high,<br>
He might not view with waking eye.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  270<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The mightiest chiefs of British song<br>
Scorn&rsquo;d not such legends to prolong:<br>
They gleam through Spenser&rsquo;s elfin dream,<br>
And mix in Milton&rsquo;s heavenly theme;<br>
And Dryden, in immortal strain,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 275<br>
Had raised the Table Round again,<br>
But that a ribald King and Court<br>
Bade him toil on, to make them sport;<br>
Demanded for their niggard pay,<br>
Fit for their souls, a looser lay,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  280<br>
Licentious satire, song, and play;<br>
The world defrauded of the high design,<br>
Profaned the God-given strength, and marr&rsquo;d the lofty line.<br>
<br>
Warm&rsquo;d by such names, well may we then,<br>
Though dwindled sons of little men,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 285<br>
Essay to break a feeble lance<br>
In the fair fields of old romance;<br>
Or seek the moated castle&rsquo;s cell,<br>
Where long through talisman and spell,<br>
While tyrants ruled, and damsels wept,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  290<br>
Thy Genius, Chivalry, hath slept:<br>
There sound the harpings of the North,<br>
Till he awake and sally forth,<br>
On venturous quest to prick again,<br>
In all his arms, with all his train,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  295<br>
Shield, lance, and brand, and plume, and scarf,<br>
Fay, giant, dragon, squire, and dwarf,<br>
And wizard with his wand of might,<br>
And errant maid on palfrey white.<br>
Around the Genius weave their spells,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 300<br>
Pure Love, who scarce his passion tells;<br>
Mystery, half veil&rsquo;d and half reveal&rsquo;d;<br>
And Honour, with his spotless shield;<br>
Attention, with fix&rsquo;d eye; and Fear,<br>
That loves the tale she shrinks to hear;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  305<br>
And gentle Courtesy; and Faith,<br>
Unchanged by sufferings, time, or death;<br>
And Valour, lion-mettled lord,<br>
Leaning upon his own good sword.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Well has thy fair achievement shown,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  310<br>
A worthy meed may thus be won;<br>
Ytene&rsquo;s oaks-beneath whose shade<br>
Their theme the merry minstrels made,<br>
Of Ascapart, and Bevis bold,<br>
And that Red King, who, while of old,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 315<br>
Through Boldrewood the chase he led,<br>
By his loved huntsman&rsquo;s arrow bled-<br>
Ytene&rsquo;s oaks have heard again<br>
Renew&rsquo;d such legendary strain;<br>
For thou hast sung, how He of Gaul,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 320<br>
That Amadis so famed in hall,<br>
For Oriana, foil&rsquo;d in fight<br>
The Necromancer&rsquo;s felon might;<br>
And well in modern verse hast wove<br>
Partenopex&rsquo;s mystic love;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; 325<br>
Hear, then, attentive to my lay,<br>
A knightly tale of Albion&rsquo;s elder day.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>CANTO FIRST</b>.<br>
<br>
<i>THE CASTLE</i>.<br>
<br>
<br>
I.<br>
<br>
Day set on Norham&rsquo;s castled steep,<br>
And Tweed&rsquo;s fair river, broad and deep,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Cheviot&rsquo;s mountains lone:<br>
The battled towers, the donjon keep,<br>
The loophole grates, where captives weep,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5<br>
The flanking walls that round it sweep,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In yellow lustre shone.<br>
The warriors on the turrets high,<br>
Moving athwart the evening sky,<br>
Seem&rsquo;d forms of giant height:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 10<br>
Their armour, as it caught the rays,<br>
Flash&rsquo;d back again the western blaze,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In lines of dazzling light.<br>
<br>
<br>
II.<br>
<br>
Saint George&rsquo;s banner, broad and gay,<br>
Now faded, as the fading ray&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
15<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Less bright, and less, was flung;<br>
The evening gale had scarce the power<br>
To wave it on the Donjon Tower,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So heavily it hung.<br>
The scouts had parted on their search,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 20<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Castle gates were barr&rsquo;d;<br>
Above the gloomy portal arch,<br>
Timing his footsteps to a march,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Warder kept his guard;<br>
Low humming, as he paced along,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  25<br>
Some ancient Border gathering-song.<br>
<br>
<br>
III.<br>
<br>
A distant trampling sound he hears;<br>
He looks abroad, and soon appears,<br>
O&rsquo;er Horncliff-hill a plump of spears,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath a pennon gay;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  30<br>
A horseman, darting from the crowd,<br>
Like lightning from a summer cloud,<br>
Spurs on his mettled courser proud,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the dark array.<br>
Beneath the sable palisade,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 35<br>
That closed the Castle barricade,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His buglehorn he blew;<br>
The warder hasted from the wall,<br>
And warn&rsquo;d the Captain in the hall,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For well the blast he knew;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 40<br>
And joyfully that knight did call,<br>
To sewer, squire, and seneschal.<br>
<br>
<br>
IV.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Now broach ye a pipe of Malvoisie,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bring pasties of the doe,<br>
And quickly make the entrance free&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 45<br>
And bid my heralds ready be,<br>
And every minstrel sound his glee,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And all our trumpets blow;<br>
And, from the platform, spare ye not<br>
To fire a noble salvo-shot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 50<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord MARMION waits below!&rsquo;<br>
Then to the Castle&rsquo;s lower ward<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sped forty yeomen tall,<br>
The iron-studded gates unbarr&rsquo;d,<br>
Raised the portcullis&rsquo; ponderous guard,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  55<br>
The lofty palisade unsparr&rsquo;d,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And let the drawbridge fall.<br>
<br>
<br>
V.<br>
<br>
Along the bridge Lord Marmion rode,<br>
Proudly his red-roan charger trode,<br>
His helm hung at the saddlebow;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  60<br>
Well by his visage you might know<br>
He was a stalworth knight, and keen,<br>
And had in many a battle been;<br>
The scar on his brown cheek reveal&rsquo;d<br>
A token true of Bosworth field;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  65<br>
His eyebrow dark, and eye of fire,<br>
Show&rsquo;d spirit proud, and prompt to ire;<br>
Yet lines of thought upon his cheek<br>
Did deep design and counsel speak.<br>
His forehead by his casque worn bare,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  70<br>
His thick mustache, and curly hair,<br>
Coal-black, and grizzled here and there,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But more through toil than age;<br>
His square-turn&rsquo;d joints, and strength of limb,<br>
Show&rsquo;d him no carpet knight so trim,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 75<br>
But in close fight a champion grim,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In camps a leader sage.<br>
<br>
<br>
VI.<br>
<br>
Well was he arm&rsquo;d from head to heel,<br>
In mail and plate of Milan steel;<br>
But his strong helm, of mighty cost,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 80<br>
Was all with burnish&rsquo;d gold emboss&rsquo;d;<br>
Amid the plumage of the crest,<br>
A falcon hover&rsquo;d on her nest,<br>
With wings outspread, and forward breast;<br>
E&rsquo;en such a falcon, on his shield,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 85<br>
Soar&rsquo;d sable in an azure field:<br>
The golden legend bore aright,<br>
Who checks at me, to death is dight.<br>
Blue was the charger&rsquo;s broider&rsquo;d rein;<br>
Blue ribbons deck&rsquo;d his arching mane;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  90<br>
The knightly housing&rsquo;s ample fold<br>
Was velvet blue, and trapp&rsquo;d with gold.<br>
<br>
<br>
VII.<br>
<br>
Behind him rode two gallant squires,<br>
Of noble name, and knightly sires;<br>
They burn&rsquo;d the gilded spurs to claim:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 95<br>
For well could each a warhorse tame,<br>
Could draw the bow, the sword could sway,<br>
And lightly bear the ring away;<br>
Nor less with courteous precepts stored,<br>
Could dance in hall, and carve at board,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  100<br>
And frame love-ditties passing rare,<br>
And sing them to a lady fair.<br>
<br>
<br>
VIII.<br>
<br>
Four men-at-arms came at their backs,<br>
With halbert, bill, and battle-axe:<br>
They bore Lord Marmion&rsquo;s lance so strong,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 105<br>
And led his sumpter-mules along,<br>
And ambling palfrey, when at need<br>
Him listed ease his battle-steed.<br>
The last and trustiest of the four,<br>
On high his forky pennon bore;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  110<br>
Like swallow&rsquo;s tail, in shape and hue,<br>
Flutter&rsquo;d the streamer glossy blue,<br>
Where, blazon&rsquo;d sable, as before,<br>
The towering falcon seem&rsquo;d to soar.<br>
Last, twenty yeomen, two and two,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 115<br>
In hosen black, and jerkins blue,<br>
With falcons broider&rsquo;d on each breast,<br>
Attended on their lord&rsquo;s behest.<br>
Each, chosen for an archer good,<br>
Knew hunting-craft by lake or wood;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 120<br>
Each one a six-foot bow could bend,<br>
And far a cloth-yard shaft could send;<br>
Each held a boar-spear tough and strong,<br>
And at their belts their quivers rung.<br>
Their dusty palfreys, and array,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  125<br>
Show&rsquo;d they had march&rsquo;d a weary way.<br>
<br>
<br>
IX.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Tis meet that I should tell you now,<br>
How fairly arm&rsquo;d, and order&rsquo;d how,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers of the guard,<br>
With musket, pike, and morion,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  130<br>
To welcome noble Marmion,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood in the Castle-yard;<br>
Minstrels and trumpeters were there,<br>
The gunner held his linstock yare,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For welcome-shot prepared:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 135<br>
Enter&rsquo;d the train, and such a clang,<br>
As then through all his turrets rang,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Norham never heard.<br>
<br>
<br>
X.<br>
<br>
The guards their morrice-pikes advanced,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The trumpets flourish&rsquo;d brave,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 140<br>
The cannon from the ramparts glanced,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And thundering welcome gave.<br>
A blithe salute, in martial sort,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The minstrels well might sound,<br>
For, as Lord Marmion cross&rsquo;d the court,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 145<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He scatter&rsquo;d angels round.<br>
&lsquo;Welcome to Norham, Marmion!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Stout heart, and open hand!<br>
Well dost thou brook thy gallant roan,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou flower of English land!&rsquo;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; 150<br>
<br>
<br>
XI.<br>
<br>
Two pursuivants, whom tabarts deck,<br>
With silver scutcheon round their neck,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood on the steps of stone,<br>
By which you reach the donjon gate,<br>
And there, with herald pomp and state,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  155<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They hail&rsquo;d Lord Marmion:<br>
They hail&rsquo;d him Lord of Fontenaye,<br>
Of Lutterward, and Scrivelbaye,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Tamworth tower and town;<br>
And he, their courtesy to requite,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  160<br>
Gave them a chain of twelve marks&rsquo; weight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All as he lighted down.<br>
&lsquo;Now, largesse, largesse, Lord Marmion,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Knight of the crest of gold!<br>
A blazon&rsquo;d shield, in battle won,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 165<br>
Ne&rsquo;er guarded heart so bold.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
XII.<br>
<br>
They marshall&rsquo;d him to the Castle-hall,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the guests stood all aside,<br>
And loudly nourish&rsquo;d the trumpet-call,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the heralds loudly cried,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
170<br>
--&lsquo;Room, lordings, room for Lord Marmion,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With the crest and helm of gold!<br>
Full well we know the trophies won<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the lists at Cottiswold:<br>
There, vainly Ralph de Wilton strove&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  175<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Gainst Marmion&rsquo;s force to stand;<br>
To him he lost his lady-love,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And to the King his land.<br>
Ourselves beheld the listed field,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A sight both sad and fair;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 180<br>
We saw Lord Marmion pierce his shield,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And saw his saddle bare;<br>
We saw the victor win the crest,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He wears with worthy pride;<br>
And on the gibbet-tree, reversed,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 185<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His foeman&rsquo;s scutcheon tied.<br>
Place, nobles, for the Falcon-Knight!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Room, room, ye gentles gay,<br>
For him who conquer&rsquo;d in the right,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Marmion of Fontenaye!&rsquo;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  190<br>
<br>
<br>
XIII.<br>
<br>
Then stepp&rsquo;d, to meet that noble Lord,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Hugh the Heron bold,<br>
Baron of Twisell, and of Ford,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Captain of the Hold.<br>
He led Lord Marmion to the deas,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  195<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Raised o&rsquo;er the pavement high,<br>
And placed him in the upper place<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They feasted full and high;<br>
The whiles a Northern harper rude<br>
Chanted a rhyme of deadly feud,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 200<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;<i>How the fierce Thirwalls, and Ridleys all,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stout Willimondswick,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Hardriding Dick,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Hughie of Hawdon, and Will o&rsquo;
the Wall,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have set on Sir Albany Featherstonhaugh,&nbsp;
&nbsp; </i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  205<br>
<i>And taken his life at the Deadman&rsquo;s-shaw</i>.&rsquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Scantly Lord Marmion&rsquo;s ear could brook<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The harper&rsquo;s barbarous lay;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet much he praised the pains he took,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And well those pains did pay&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 210<br>
For lady&rsquo;s suit, and minstrel&rsquo;s strain,<br>
By knight should ne&rsquo;er be heard in vain,<br>
<br>
<br>
XIV.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Now, good Lord Marmion,&rsquo; Heron says,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Of your fair courtesy,<br>
I pray you bide some little space&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 215<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In this poor tower with me.<br>
Here may you keep your arms from rust,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;May breathe your war-horse well;<br>
Seldom hath pass&rsquo;d a week but giust<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or feat of arms befell:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; 220<br>
The Scots can rein a mettled steed;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And love to couch a spear:-<br>
Saint George! a stirring life they lead,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That have such neighbours near.<br>
Then stay with us a little space,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 225<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our northern wars to learn;<br>
I pray you, for your lady&rsquo;s grace!&rsquo;-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Marmion&rsquo;s brow grew stern.<br>
<br>
<br>
XV.<br>
<br>
The Captain mark&rsquo;d his alter&rsquo;d look,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And gave a squire the sign;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
230<br>
A mighty wassell-bowl he took,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And crown&rsquo;d it high with wine.<br>
&lsquo;Now pledge me here, Lord Marmion:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But first I pray thee fair,<br>
Where hast thou left that page of thine,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  235<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That used to serve thy cup of wine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose beauty was so rare?<br>
When last in Raby towers we met,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy I closely eyed,<br>
And often mark&rsquo;d his cheeks were wet,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 240<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With tears he fain would hide:<br>
His was no rugged horse-boy&rsquo;s hand,<br>
To burnish shield or sharpen brand,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or saddle battle-steed;<br>
But meeter seem&rsquo;d for lady fair,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  245<br>
To fan her cheek, or curl her hair,<br>
Or through embroidery, rich and rare,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The slender silk to lead:<br>
His skin was fair, his ringlets gold,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His bosom-when he sigh&rsquo;d,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;  250<br>
The russet doublet&rsquo;s rugged fold<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Could scarce repel its pride!<br>
Say, hast thou given that lovely youth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To serve in lady&rsquo;s bower?<br>
Or was the gentle page, in sooth,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 255<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A gentle paramour?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
XVI.<br>
<br>
Lord Marmion ill could brook such jest;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He roll&rsquo;d his kindling eye,<br>
With pain his rising wrath suppress&rsquo;d,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet made a calm reply:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  260<br>
&lsquo;That boy thou thought&rsquo;st so goodly fair,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He might not brook the northern air.<br>
More of his fate if thou wouldst learn,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I left him sick in Lindisfarn:<br>
Enough of him.-But, Heron, say,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  265<br>
Why does thy lovely lady gay<br>
Disdain to grace the hall to-day?<br>
Or has that dame, so fair and sage,<br>
Gone on some pious pilgrimage?&rsquo;-<br>
He spoke in covert scorn, for fame&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  270<br>
Whisper&rsquo;d light tales of Heron&rsquo;s dame.<br>
<br>
<br>
XVII.<br>
<br>
Unmark&rsquo;d, at least unreck&rsquo;d, the taunt,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Careless the Knight replied,<br>
&lsquo;No bird, whose feathers gaily flaunt,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Delights in cage to bide:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; 275<br>
Norham is grim and grated close,<br>
Hemm&rsquo;d in by battlement and fosse,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And many a darksome tower;<br>
And better loves my lady bright<br>
To sit in liberty and light,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  280<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In fair Queen Margaret&rsquo;s bower.<br>
We hold our greyhound in our hand,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our falcon on our glove;<br>
But where shall we find leash or band,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For dame that loves to rove?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 285<br>
Let the wild falcon soar her swing,<br>
She&rsquo;ll stoop when she has tired her wing.&rsquo;--<br>
<br>
<br>
XVIII.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Nay, if with Royal James&rsquo;s bride<br>
The lovely Lady Heron bide,<br>
Behold me here a messenger,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
290<br>
Your tender greetings prompt to bear;<br>
For, to the Scottish court address&rsquo;d,<br>
I journey at our King&rsquo;s behest,<br>
And pray you, of your grace, provide<br>
For me, and mine, a trusty guide.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 295<br>
I have not ridden in Scotland since<br>
James back&rsquo;d the cause of that mock prince,<br>
Warbeck, that Flemish counterfeit,<br>
Who on the gibbet paid the cheat.<br>
Then did I march with Surrey&rsquo;s power,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 300<br>
What time we razed old Ayton tower.&rsquo;-<br>
<br>
<br>
XIX.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;For such-like need, my lord, I trow,<br>
Norham can find you guides enow;<br>
For here be some have prick&rsquo;d as far,<br>
On Scottish ground, as to Dunbar;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 305<br>
Have drunk the monks of St. Bothan&rsquo;s ale,<br>
And driven the beeves of Lauderdale;<br>
Harried the wives of Greenlaw&rsquo;s goods,<br>
And given them light to set their hoods.&rsquo;-<br>
<br>
<br>
XX.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Now, in good sooth,&rsquo; Lord Marmion cried,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 310<br>
&lsquo;Were I in warlike wise to ride,<br>
A better guard I would not lack,<br>
Than your stout forayers at my back;<br>
But as in form of peace I go,<br>
A friendly messenger, to know,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  315<br>
Why through all Scotland, near and far,<br>
Their King is mustering troops for war,<br>
The sight of plundering Border spears<br>
Might justify suspicious fears,<br>
And deadly feud, or thirst of spoil,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  320<br>
Break out in some unseemly broil:<br>
A herald were my fitting guide;<br>
Or friar, sworn in peace to bide;<br>
Or pardoner, or travelling priest,<br>
Or strolling pilgrim, at the least.&rsquo;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  325<br>
<br>
<br>
XXI.<br>
<br>
The Captain mused a little space,<br>
And pass&rsquo;d his hand across his face.<br>
-&rsquo;Fain would I find the guide you want,<br>
But ill may spare a pursuivant,<br>
The only men that safe can ride&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 330<br>
Mine errands on the Scottish side:<br>
And though a bishop built this fort,<br>
Few holy brethren here resort;<br>
Even our good chaplain, as I ween,<br>
Since our last siege, we have not seen:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 335<br>
The mass he might not sing or say,<br>
Upon one stinted meal a-day;<br>
So, safe he sat in Durham aisle,<br>
And pray&rsquo;d for our success the while.<br>
Our Norham vicar, woe betide,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 340<br>
Is all too well in case to ride;<br>
The priest of Shoreswood-he could rein<br>
The wildest war-horse in your train;<br>
But then, no spearman in the hall<br>
Will sooner swear, or stab, or brawl.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 345<br>
Friar John of Tillmouth were the man:<br>
A blithesome brother at the can,<br>
A welcome guest in hall and bower,<br>
He knows each castle, town, and tower,<br>
In which the wine and ale is good,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  350<br>
&lsquo;Twixt Newcastle and Holy-Rood.<br>
But that good man, as ill befalls,<br>
Hath seldom left our castle walls,<br>
Since, on the vigil of St. Bede,<br>
In evil hour, he cross&rsquo;d the Tweed,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 355<br>
To teach Dame Alison her creed.<br>
Old Bughtrig found him with his wife;<br>
And John, an enemy to strife,<br>
Sans frock and hood, fled for his life.<br>
The jealous churl hath deeply swore,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  360<br>
That, if again he venture o&rsquo;er,<br>
He shall shrieve penitent no more.<br>
Little he loves such risks, I know;<br>
Yet, in your guard, perchance will go.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
XXII.<br>
<br>
Young Selby, at the fair hall-board,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  365<br>
Carved to his uncle and that lord,<br>
And reverently took up the word.<br>
&lsquo;Kind uncle, woe were we each one,<br>
If harm should hap to brother John.<br>
He is a man of mirthful speech,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 370<br>
Can many a game and gambol teach;<br>
Full well at tables can he play,<br>
And sweep at bowls the stake away.<br>
None can a lustier carol bawl,<br>
The needfullest among us all,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 375<br>
When time hangs heavy in the hall,<br>
And snow comes thick at Christmas tide,<br>
And we can neither hunt, nor ride<br>
A foray on the Scottish side.<br>
The vow&rsquo;d revenge of Bughtrig rude,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 380<br>
May end in worse than loss of hood.<br>
Let Friar John, in safety, still<br>
In chimney-corner snore his fill,<br>
Roast hissing crabs, or flagons swill:<br>
Last night, to Norham there came one,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 385<br>
Will better guide Lord Marmion.&rsquo;-<br>
&lsquo;Nephew,&rsquo; quoth Heron, &lsquo;by my fay,<br>
Well hast thou spoke; say forth thy say,&rsquo;-<br>
<br>
<br>
XXIII<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Here is a holy Palmer come,<br>
From Salem first, and last from Rome;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 390<br>
One, that hath kiss&rsquo;d the blessed tomb,<br>
And visited each holy shrine,<br>
In Araby and Palestine;<br>
On hills of Armenie hath been,<br>
Where Noah&rsquo;s ark may yet be seen;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 395<br>
By that Red Sea, too, hath he trod,<br>
Which parted at the Prophet&rsquo;s rod;<br>
In Sinai&rsquo;s wilderness he saw<br>
The Mount, where Israel heard the law,<br>
&lsquo;Mid thunder-dint and flashing levin,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 400<br>
And shadows, mists, and darkness, given.<br>
He shows Saint James&rsquo;s cockle-shell,<br>
Of fair Montserrat, too, can tell;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And of that Grot where Olives nod,<br>
Where, darling of each heart and eye,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 405<br>
From all the youth of Sicily,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Rosalie retired to God.<br>
<br>
<br>
XXIV.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;To stout Saint George of Norwich merry,<br>
Saint Thomas, too, of Canterbury,<br>
Cuthbert of Durham and Saint Bede,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  410<br>
For his sins&rsquo; pardon hath he pray&rsquo;d.<br>
He knows the passes of the North,<br>
And seeks far shrines beyond the Forth;<br>
Little he eats, and long will wake,<br>
And drinks but of the stream or lake.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 415<br>
This were a guide o&rsquo;er moor and dale;<br>
But, when our John hath quaff&rsquo;d his ale,<br>
As little as the wind that blows,<br>
And warms itself against his nose,<br>
Kens he, or cares, which way he goes.&rsquo;-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  420<br>
<br>
<br>
XXV.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Gramercy!&rsquo; quoth Lord Marmion,<br>
&lsquo;Full loth were I, that Friar John,<br>
That venerable man, for me,<br>
Were placed in fear or jeopardy.<br>
If this same Palmer will me lead&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  425<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From hence to Holy-Rood,<br>
Like his good saint, I&rsquo;ll pay his meed,<br>
Instead of cockle-shell, or bead,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With angels fair and good.<br>
I love such holy ramblers; still&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  430<br>
They know to charm a weary hill,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With song, romance, or lay:<br>
Some jovial tale, or glee, or jest,<br>
Some lying legend, at the least,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They bring to cheer the way.&rsquo;-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
435<br>
<br>
<br>
XXVI.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Ah! noble sir,&rsquo; young Selby said,<br>
And finger on his lip he laid,<br>
&lsquo;This man knows much, perchance e&rsquo;en more<br>
Than he could learn by holy lore.<br>
Still to himself he&rsquo;s muttering,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  440<br>
And shrinks as at some unseen thing.<br>
Last night we listen&rsquo;d at his cell;<br>
Strange sounds we heard, and, sooth to tell,<br>
He murmur&rsquo;d on till morn, howe&rsquo;er<br>
No living mortal could be near.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 445<br>
Sometimes I thought I heard it plain,<br>
As other voices spoke again.<br>
I cannot tell-I like it not-<br>
Friar John hath told us it is wrote,<br>
No conscience clear, and void of wrong,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 450<br>
Can rest awake, and pray so long.<br>
Himself still sleeps before his beads<br>
Have mark&rsquo;d ten aves, and two creeds.&rsquo;-<br>
<br>
<br>
XXVII.<br>
<br>
-&lsquo;Let pass,&rsquo; quoth Marmion; &lsquo;by my fay,<br>
This man shall guide me on my way,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  455<br>
Although the great arch-fiend and he<br>
Had sworn themselves of company.<br>
So please you, gentle youth, to call<br>
This Palmer to the Castle-hall.&rsquo;<br>
The summon&rsquo;d Palmer came in place;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  460<br>
His sable cowl o&rsquo;erhung his face;<br>
In his black mantle was he clad,<br>
With Peter&rsquo;s keys, in cloth of red,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On his broad shoulders wrought;<br>
The scallop shell his cap did deck;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 465<br>
The crucifix around his neck<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was from Loretto brought;<br>
His sandals were with travel tore,<br>
Staff, budget, bottle, scrip, he wore;<br>
The faded palm-branch in his hand&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 470<br>
Show&rsquo;d pilgrim from the Holy Land.<br>
<br>
<br>
XXVIII.<br>
<br>
When as the Palmer came in hall,<br>
Nor lord, nor knight, was there more tall,<br>
Or had a statelier step withal,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or look&rsquo;d more high and keen;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; 475<br>
For no saluting did he wait,<br>
But strode across the hall of state,<br>
And fronted Marmion where he sate,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As he his peer had been.<br>
But his gaunt frame was worn with toil;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 480<br>
His cheek was sunk, alas the while!<br>
And when he struggled at a smile,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His eye look &lsquo;d haggard wild:<br>
Poor wretch! the mother that him bare,<br>
If she had been in presence there,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  485<br>
In his wan face, and sun-burn&rsquo;d hair,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She had not known her child.<br>
Danger, long travel, want, or woe,<br>
Soon change the form that best we know-<br>
For deadly fear can time outgo,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 490<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And blanch at once the hair;<br>
Hard toil can roughen form and face,<br>
And want can quench the eye&rsquo;s bright grace,<br>
Nor does old age a wrinkle trace<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;More deeply than despair.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; 495<br>
Happy whom none of these befall,<br>
But this poor Palmer knew them all.<br>
<br>
<br>
XXIX.<br>
<br>
Lord Marmion then his boon did ask;<br>
The Palmer took on him the task,<br>
So he would march with morning tide,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  500<br>
To Scottish court to be his guide.<br>
&lsquo;But I have solemn vows to pay,<br>
And may not linger by the way,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To fair St. Andrews bound,<br>
Within the ocean-cave to pray,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  505<br>
Where good Saint Rule his holy lay,<br>
From midnight to the dawn of day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sung to the billows&rsquo; sound;<br>
Thence to Saint Fillan&rsquo;s blessed well,<br>
Whose spring can frenzied dreams dispel,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  510<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the crazed brain restore:<br>
Saint Mary grant, that cave or spring<br>
Could back to peace my bosom bring,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or bid it throb no more!&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
XXX.<br>
<br>
And now the midnight draught of sleep,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  515<br>
Where wine and spices richly steep,<br>
In massive bowl of silver deep,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The page presents on knee.<br>
Lord Marmion drank a fair good rest,<br>
The Captain pledged his noble guest,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  520<br>
The cup went through among the rest,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who drain&rsquo;d it merrily;<br>
Alone the Palmer pass&rsquo;d it by,<br>
Though Selby press&rsquo;d him courteously.<br>
This was a sign the feast was o&rsquo;er;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 525<br>
It hush&rsquo;d the merry wassel roar,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The minstrels ceased to sound.<br>
Soon in the castle nought was heard,<br>
But the slow footstep of the guard,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Pacing his sober round.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; 530<br>
<br>
<br>
XXXI.<br>
<br>
With early dawn Lord Marmion rose:<br>
And first the chapel doors unclose;<br>
Then, after morning rites were done,<br>
(A hasty mass from Friar John,)<br>
And knight and squire had broke their fast,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 535<br>
On rich substantial repast,<br>
Lord Marmion&rsquo;s bugles blew to horse:<br>
Then came the stirrup-cup in course:<br>
Between the Baron and his host,<br>
No point of courtesy was lost;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  540<br>
High thanks were by Lord Marmion paid,<br>
Solemn excuse the Captain made,<br>
Till, filing from the gate, had pass&rsquo;d<br>
That noble train, their Lord the last.<br>
Then loudly rung the trumpet call;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  545<br>
Thunder&rsquo;d the cannon from the wall,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And shook the Scottish shore;<br>
Around the castle eddied slow,<br>
Volumes of smoke as white as snow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And hid its turrets hoar;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; 550<br>
Till they roli&rsquo;d forth upon the air,<br>
And met the river breezes there,<br>
Which gave again the prospect fair.<br>

<b>INTRODUCTION TO CANTO SECOND</b>.<br>
<br>
<i>TO THE REV JOHN MARRIOTT, A. M.<br>
<br>
Ashestiel, Ettrick Forest</i>.<br>
<br>
The scenes are desert now, and bare<br>
Where flourish&rsquo;d once a forest fair,<br>
When these waste glens with copse were lined,<br>
And peopled with the hart and hind.<br>
Yon Thorn-perchance whose prickly spears&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5<br>
Have fenced him for three hundred years,<br>
While fell around his green compeers-<br>
Yon lonely Thorn, would he could tell<br>
The changes of his parent dell,<br>
Since he, so grey and stubborn now,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  10<br>
Waved in each breeze a sapling bough;<br>
Would he could tell how deep the shade<br>
A thousand mingled branches made;<br>
How broad the shadows of the oak,<br>
How clung the rowan to the rock,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 15<br>
And through the foliage show&rsquo;d his head,<br>
With narrow leaves and berries red;<br>
What pines on every mountain sprung,<br>
O&rsquo;er every dell what birches hung,<br>
In every breeze what aspens shook,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 20<br>
What alders shaded every brook!<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Here, in my shade,&rsquo; methinks he&rsquo;d say,<br>
&lsquo;The mighty stag at noon-tide lay:<br>
The wolf I&rsquo;ve seen, a fiercer game,<br>
(The neighbouring dingle bears his name,)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  25<br>
With lurching step around me prowl,<br>
And stop, against the moon to howl;<br>
The mountain-boar, on battle set,<br>
His tusks upon my stem would whet;<br>
While doe, and roe, and red-deer good,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 30<br>
Have bounded by, through gay green-wood.<br>
Then oft, from Newark&rsquo;s riven tower,<br>
Sallied a Scottish monarch&rsquo;s power:<br>
A thousand vassals muster&rsquo;d round,<br>
With horse, and hawk, and horn, and hound;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 35<br>
And I might see the youth intent,<br>
Guard every pass with crossbow bent;<br>
And through the brake the rangers stalk,<br>
And falc&rsquo;ners hold the ready hawk,<br>
And foresters, in green-wood trim,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 40<br>
Lead in the leash the gazehounds grim,<br>
Attentive, as the bratchet&rsquo;s bay<br>
From the dark covert drove the prey,<br>
To slip them as he broke away.<br>
The startled quarry bounds amain,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  45<br>
As fast the gallant greyhounds strain;<br>
Whistles the arrow from the bow,<br>
Answers the harquebuss below;<br>
While all the rocking hills reply,<br>
To hoof-clang, hound, and hunters&rsquo; cry,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  50<br>
And bugles ringing lightsomely.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of such proud huntings, many tales<br>
Yet linger in our lonely dales,<br>
Up pathless Ettrick and on Yarrow,<br>
Where erst the outlaw drew his arrow.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  55<br>
But not more blithe that silvan court,<br>
Than we have been at humbler sport;<br>
Though small our pomp, and mean our game,<br>
Our mirth, dear Marriott, was the same.<br>
Remember&rsquo;st thou my greyhounds true?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 60<br>
O&rsquo;er holt or hill there never flew,<br>
From slip or leash there never sprang,<br>
More fleet of foot, or sure of fang.<br>
Nor dull, between each merry chase,<br>
Pass&rsquo;d by the intermitted space;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 65<br>
For we had fair resource in store,<br>
In Classic and in Gothic lore:<br>
We mark&rsquo;d each memorable scene,<br>
And held poetic talk between;<br>
Nor hill, nor brook, we paced along,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 70<br>
But had its legend or its song.<br>
All silent now-for now are still<br>
Thy bowers, untenanted Bowhill!<br>
No longer, from thy mountains dun,<br>
The yeoman hears the well-known gun,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 75<br>
And while his honest heart glows warm,<br>
At thought of his paternal farm,<br>
Round to his mates a brimmer fills,<br>
And drinks, &lsquo;The Chieftain of the Hills!&rsquo;<br>
No fairy forms, in Yarrow&rsquo;s bowers,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  80<br>
Trip o&rsquo;er the walks, or tend the flowers,<br>
Fair as the elves whom Janet saw<br>
By moonlight dance on Carterhaugh;<br>
No youthful Baron&rsquo;s left to grace<br>
The Forest-Sheriff&rsquo;s lonely chase,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 85<br>
And ape, in manly step and tone,<br>
The majesty of Oberon:<br>
And she is gone, whose lovely face<br>
Is but her least and lowest grace;<br>
Though if to Sylphid Queen &lsquo;twere given,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 90<br>
To show our earth the charms of Heaven,<br>
She could not glide along the air,<br>
With form more light, or face more fair.<br>
No more the widow&rsquo;s deafen&rsquo;d ear<br>
Grows quick that lady&rsquo;s step to hear:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  95<br>
At noontide she expects her not,<br>
Nor busies her to trim the cot;<br>
Pensive she turns her humming wheel,<br>
Or pensive cooks her orphans&rsquo; meal,<br>
Yet blesses, ere she deals their bread,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 100<br>
The gentle hand by which they&rsquo;re fed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From Yair,-which hills so closely bind,<br>
Scarce can the Tweed his passage find,<br>
Though much he fret, and chafe, and toil,<br>
Till all his eddying currents boil,-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 105<br>
Her long descended lord is gone,<br>
And left us by the stream alone.<br>
And much I miss those sportive boys,<br>
Companions of my mountain joys,<br>
Just at the age &lsquo;twixt boy and youth,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 110<br>
When thought is speech, and speech is truth.<br>
Close to my side, with what delight<br>
They press&rsquo;d to hear of Wallace wight,<br>
When, pointing to his airy mound,<br>
I call&rsquo;d his ramparts holy ground!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  115<br>
Kindled their brows to hear me speak;<br>
And I have smiled, to feel my cheek,<br>
Despite the difference of our years,<br>
Return again the glow of theirs.<br>
Ah, happy boys! such feelings pure,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 120<br>
They will not, cannot long endure;<br>
Condemn&rsquo;d to stem the world&rsquo;s rude tide,<br>
You may not linger by the side;<br>
For Fate shall thrust you from the shore,<br>
And passion ply the sail and oar.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 125<br>
Yet cherish the remembrance still,<br>
Of the lone mountain, and the rill;<br>
For trust, dear boys, the time will come,<br>
When fiercer transport shall be dumb,<br>
And you will think right frequently,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  130<br>
But, well I hope, without a sigh,<br>
On the free hours that we have spent,<br>
Together, on the brown hill&rsquo;s bent.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When, musing on companions gone,<br>
We doubly feel ourselves alone,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 135<br>
Something, my friend, we yet may gain,<br>
There is a pleasure in this pain:<br>
It soothes the love of lonely rest,<br>
Deep in each gentler heart impress&rsquo;d.<br>
&lsquo;Tis silent amid worldly toils,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 140<br>
And stifled soon by mental broils;<br>
But, in a bosom thus prepared,<br>
Its still small voice is often heard,<br>
Whispering a mingled sentiment,<br>
&lsquo;Twixt resignation and content.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 145<br>
Oft in my mind such thoughts awake,<br>
By lone Saint Mary&rsquo;s silent lake;<br>
Thou know&rsquo;st it well,-nor fen, nor sedge,<br>
Pollute the pure lake&rsquo;s crystal edge;<br>
Abrupt and sheer, the mountains sink&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  150<br>
At once upon the level brink;<br>
And just a trace of silver sand<br>
Marks where the water meets the land.<br>
Far in the mirror, bright and blue,<br>
Each hill&rsquo;s huge outline you may view;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  155<br>
Shaggy with heath, but lonely bare,<br>
Nor tree, nor bush, nor brake, is there,<br>
Save where, of land, yon slender line<br>
Bears thwart the lake the scatter&rsquo;d pine.<br>
Yet even this nakedness has power,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  160<br>
And aids the feeling of the hour:<br>
Nor thicket, dell, nor copse you spy,<br>
Where living thing conceal&rsquo;d might lie;<br>
Nor point, retiring, hides a dell,<br>
Where swain, or woodman lone, might dwell;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  165<br>
There&rsquo;s nothing left to fancy&rsquo;s guess,<br>
You see that all is loneliness:<br>
And silence aids-though the steep hills<br>
Send to the lake a thousand rills;<br>
In summer tide, so soft they weep,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  170<br>
The sound but lulls the ear asleep;<br>
Your horse&rsquo;s hoof-tread sounds too rude,<br>
So stilly is the solitude.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nought living meets the eye or ear,<br>
But well I ween the dead are near;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  175<br>
For though, in feudal strife, a foe<br>
Hath laid Our Lady&rsquo;s chapel low,<br>
Yet still, beneath the hallow&rsquo;d soil,<br>
The peasant rests him from his toil,<br>
And, dying, bids his bones be laid,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 180<br>
Where erst his simple fathers pray&rsquo;d.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If age had tamed the passions&rsquo; strife,<br>
And fate had cut my ties to life,<br>
Here have I thought, &lsquo;twere sweet to dwell,<br>
And rear again the chaplain&rsquo;s cell,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 185<br>
Like that same peaceful hermitage,<br>
Where Milton long&rsquo;d to spend his age.<br>
&lsquo;Twere sweet to mark the setting day,<br>
On Bourhope&rsquo;s lonely top decay;<br>
And, as it faint and feeble died&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  190<br>
On the broad lake, and mountain&rsquo;s side,<br>
To say, &lsquo;Thus pleasures fade away;<br>
Youth, talents, beauty thus decay,<br>
And leave us dark, forlorn, and grey;&rsquo;<br>
Then gaze on Dryhope&rsquo;s ruin&rsquo;d tower,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  195<br>
And think on Yarrow&rsquo;s faded Flower:<br>
And when that mountain-sound I heard,<br>
Which bids us be for storm prepared,<br>
The distant rustling of his wings,<br>
As up his force the Tempest brings,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 200<br>
&lsquo;Twere sweet, ere yet his terrors rave,<br>
To sit upon the Wizard&rsquo;s grave;<br>
That Wizard Priest&rsquo;s, whose bones are thrust,<br>
From company of holy dust;<br>
On which no sunbeam ever shines-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 205<br>
(So superstition&rsquo;s creed divines)-<br>
Thence view the lake, with sullen roar,<br>
Heave her broad billows to the shore;<br>
And mark the wild-swans mount the gale,<br>
Spread wide through mist their snowy sail,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  210<br>
And ever stoop again, to lave<br>
Their bosoms on the surging wave;<br>
Then, when against the driving hail<br>
No longer might my plaid avail,<br>
Back to my lonely home retire,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  215<br>
And light my lamp, and trim my fire;<br>
There ponder o&rsquo;er some mystic lay,<br>
Till the wild tale had all its sway,<br>
And, in the bittern&rsquo;s distant shriek,<br>
I heard unearthly voices speak,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 220<br>
And thought the Wizard Priest was come,<br>
To claim again his ancient home!<br>
And bade my busy fancy range,<br>
To frame him fitting shape and strange,<br>
Till from the task my brow I clear&rsquo;d,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 225<br>
And smiled to think that I had fear&rsquo;d.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But chief, &lsquo;twere sweet to think such life,<br>
(Though but escape from fortune&rsquo;s strife,)<br>
Something most matchless good and wise,<br>
A great and grateful sacrifice;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 230<br>
And deem each hour, to musing given,<br>
A step upon the road to heaven.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet him, whose heart is ill at ease,<br>
Such peaceful solitudes displease;<br>
He loves to drown his bosom&rsquo;s jar&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 235<br>
Amid the elemental war:<br>
And my black Palmer&rsquo;s choice had been<br>
Some ruder and more savage scene,<br>
Like that which frowns round dark Loch-skene.<br>
There eagles scream from isle to shore;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 240<br>
Down all the rocks the torrents roar;<br>
O&rsquo;er the black waves incessant driven,<br>
Dark mists infect the summer heaven;<br>
Through the rude barriers of the lake,<br>
Away its hurrying waters break,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 245<br>
Faster and whiter dash and curl,<br>
Till down yon dark abyss they hurl.<br>
Rises the fog-smoke white as snow,<br>
Thunders the viewless stream below,<br>
Diving, as if condemn&rsquo;d to lave&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 250<br>
Some demon&rsquo;s subterranean cave,<br>
Who, prison&rsquo;d by enchanter&rsquo;s spell,<br>
Shakes the dark rock with groan and yell.<br>
And well that Palmer&rsquo;s form and mien<br>
Had suited with the stormy scene,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 255<br>
Just on the edge, straining his ken<br>
To view the bottom of the den,<br>
Where, deep deep down, and far within,<br>
Toils with the rocks the roaring linn;<br>
Then, issuing forth one foamy wave,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 260<br>
And wheeling round the Giant&rsquo;s Grave,<br>
White as the snowy charger&rsquo;s tail,<br>
Drives down the pass of Moffatdale.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Marriott, thy harp, on Isis strung,<br>
To many a Border theme has rung:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  265<br>
Then list to me, and thou shalt know<br>
Of this mysterious Man of Woe.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>CANTO SECOND</b>.<br>
<br>
THE CONVENT.<br>
<br>
1.<br>
<br>
THE breeze, which swept away the smoke<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Round Norham Castle roll&rsquo;d,<br>
When all the loud artillery spoke,<br>
With lightning-flash, and thunder-stroke,<br>
As Marmion left the Hold,-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; 5<br>
It curl&rsquo;d not Tweed alone, that breeze,<br>
For, far upon Northumbrian seas,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It freshly blew, and strong,<br>
Where, from high Whitby&rsquo;s cloister&rsquo;d pile,<br>
Bound to Saint Cuthbert&rsquo;s Holy Isle,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 10<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It bore a bark along.<br>
Upon the gale she stoop&rsquo;d her side,<br>
And bounded o&rsquo;er the swelling tide,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As she were dancing home;<br>
The merry seamen laugh&rsquo;d, to see&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 15<br>
Their gallant ship so lustily<br>
Furrow the green sea-foam.<br>
Much joy&rsquo;d they in their honour&rsquo;d freight;<br>
For, on the deck, in chair of state,<br>
The Abbess of Saint Hilda placed,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  20<br>
With five fair nuns, the galley graced.<br>
<br>
<br>
II.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Twas sweet, to see these holy maids,<br>
Like birds escaped to green-wood shades,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their first flight from the cage,<br>
How timid, and how curious too,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  25<br>
For all to them was strange and new,<br>
And all the common sights they view,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their wonderment engage.<br>
One eyed the shrouds and swelling sail,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With many a benedicite;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  30<br>
One at the rippling surge grew pale,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And would for terror pray;<br>
Then shriek&rsquo;d, because the seadog, nigh,<br>
His round black head, and sparkling eye,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rear&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er the foaming spray;&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; 35<br>
And one would still adjust her veil,<br>
Disorder&rsquo;d by the summer gale,<br>
Perchance lest some more worldly eye<br>
Her dedicated charms might spy;<br>
Perchance, because such action graced&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  40<br>
Her fair-turn&rsquo;d arm and slender waist.<br>
Light was each simple bosom there,<br>
Save two, who ill might pleasure share,-<br>
The Abbess, and the Novice Clare.<br>
<br>
<br>
III.<br>
<br>
The Abbess was of noble blood,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 45<br>
But early took the veil and hood,<br>
Ere upon life she cast a look,<br>
Or knew the world that she forsook.<br>
Fair too she was, and kind had been<br>
As she was fair, but ne&rsquo;er had seen&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  50<br>
For her a timid lover sigh,<br>
Nor knew the influence of her eye.<br>
Love, to her ear, was but a name,<br>
Combined with vanity and shame;<br>
Her hopes, her fears, her joys, were all&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 55<br>
Bounded within the cloister wall:<br>
The deadliest sin her mind could reach<br>
Was of monastic rule the breach;<br>
And her ambition&rsquo;s highest aim<br>
To emulate Saint Hilda&rsquo;s fame.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
60<br>
For this she gave her ample dower,<br>
To raise the convent&rsquo;s eastern tower;<br>
For this, with carving rare and quaint,<br>
She deck&rsquo;d the chapel of the saint,<br>
And gave the relic-shrine of cost,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 65<br>
With ivory and gems emboss&rsquo;d.<br>
The poor her Convent&rsquo;s bounty blest,<br>
The pilgrim in its halls found rest.<br>
<br>
<br>
IV.<br>
<br>
Black was her garb, her rigid rule<br>
Reform&rsquo;d on Benedictine school;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  70<br>
Her cheek was pale, her form was spare:<br>
Vigils, and penitence austere,<br>
Had early quench&rsquo;d the light of youth,<br>
But gentle was the dame, in sooth;<br>
Though, vain of her religious sway,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  75<br>
She loved to see her maids obey,<br>
Yet nothing stern was she in cell,<br>
And the nuns loved their Abbess well.<br>
Sad was this voyage to the dame;<br>
Summon&rsquo;d to Lindisfame, she came,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  80<br>
There, with Saint Cuthbert&rsquo;s Abbot old,<br>
And Tynemouth&rsquo;s Prioress, to hold<br>
A chapter of Saint Benedict,<br>
For inquisition stern and strict,<br>
On two apostates from the faith,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 85<br>
And, if need were, to doom to death.<br>
<br>
<br>
V.<br>
<br>
Nought say I here of Sister Clare,<br>
Save this, that she was young and fair;<br>
As yet a novice unprofess&rsquo;d,<br>
Lovely and gentle, but distress&rsquo;d.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 90<br>
She was betroth&rsquo;d to one now dead,<br>
Or worse, who had dishonour&rsquo;d fled.<br>
Her kinsmen bade her give her hand<br>
To one, who loved her for her land:<br>
Herself, almost broken-hearted now,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  95<br>
Was bent to take the vestal vow,<br>
And shroud, within Saint Hilda&rsquo;s gloom,<br>
Her blasted hopes and wither&rsquo;d bloom.<br>
<br>
<br>
VI.<br>
<br>
She sate upon the galley&rsquo;s prow,<br>
And seem&rsquo;d to mark the waves below;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 100<br>
Nay, seem&rsquo;d, so fix&rsquo;d her look and eye,<br>
To count them as they glided by.<br>
She saw them not-&lsquo;twas seeming all-<br>
Far other scene her thoughts recall,-<br>
A sun-scorch&rsquo;d desert, waste and bare,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  105<br>
Nor waves, nor breezes, murmur&rsquo;d there;<br>
There saw she, where some careless hand<br>
O&rsquo;er a dead corpse had heap&rsquo;d the sand,<br>
To hide it till the jackals come,<br>
To tear it from the scanty tomb.-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  110<br>
See what a woful look was given,<br>
As she raised up her eyes to heaven!<br>
<br>
<br>
VII.<br>
<br>
Lovely, and gentle, and distress&rsquo;d-<br>
These charms might tame the fiercest breast:<br>
Harpers have sung, and poets told,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  115<br>
That he, in fury uncontroll&rsquo;d,<br>
The shaggy monarch of the wood,<br>
Before a virgin, fair and good,<br>
Hath pacified his savage mood.<br>
But passions in the human frame,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  120<br>
Oft put the lion&rsquo;s rage to shame:<br>
And jealousy, by dark intrigue,<br>
With sordid avarice in league,<br>
Had practised with their bowl and knife,<br>
Against the mourner&rsquo;s harmless life.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  125<br>
This crime was charged &lsquo;gainst those who lay<br>
Prison&rsquo;d in Cuthbert&rsquo;s islet grey.<br>
<br>
<br>
VIII.<br>
<br>
And now the vessel skirts the strand<br>
Of mountainous Northumberland;<br>
Towns, towers, and halls, successive rise,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  130<br>
And catch the nuns&rsquo; delighted eyes.<br>
Monk-Wearmouth soon behind them lay,<br>
And Tynemouth&rsquo;s priory and bay;<br>
They mark&rsquo;d, amid her trees, the hall<br>
Of lofty Seaton-Delaval;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 135<br>
They saw the Blythe and Wansbeck floods<br>
Rush to the sea through sounding woods;<br>
They pass&rsquo;d the tower of Widderington,<br>
Mother of many a valiant son;<br>
At Coquet-isle their beads they tell&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  140<br>
To the good Saint who own&rsquo;d the cell;<br>
Then did the Alne attention claim,<br>
And Warkworth, proud of Percy&rsquo;s name;<br>
And next, they cross&rsquo;d themselves, to hear<br>
The whitening breakers sound so near,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 145<br>
There, boiling through the rocks, they roar,<br>
On Dunstanborough&rsquo;s cavern&rsquo;d shore;<br>
Thy tower, proud Bamborough, mark&rsquo;d they there,<br>
King Ida&rsquo;s castle, huge and square,<br>
From its tall rock look grimly down,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  150<br>
And on the swelling ocean frown;<br>
Then from the coast they bore away,<br>
And reach&rsquo;d the Holy Island&rsquo;s bay.<br>
<br>
<br>
IX.<br>
<br>
The tide did now its flood-mark gain,<br>
And girdled in the Saint&rsquo;s domain:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  155<br>
For, with the flow and ebb, its style<br>
Varies from continent to isle;<br>
Dry-shod, o&rsquo;er sands, twice every day,<br>
The pilgrims to the shrine find way;<br>
Twice every day, the waves efface&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 160<br>
Of staves and sandall&rsquo;d feet the trace.<br>
As to the port the galley flew,<br>
Higher and higher rose to view<br>
The Castle with its battled walls,<br>
The ancient Monastery&rsquo;s halls,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  165<br>
A solemn, huge, and dark-red pile,<br>
Placed on the margin of the isle.<br>
<br>
<br>
X.<br>
<br>
In Saxon strength that Abbey frown&rsquo;d,<br>
With massive arches broad and round,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That rose alternate, row and row,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 170<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On ponderous columns, short and low,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Built ere the art was known,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By pointed aisle, and shafted stalk,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The arcades of an alley&rsquo;d walk<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To emulate in stone.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  175<br>
On the deep walls, the heathen Dane<br>
Had pour&rsquo;d his impious rage in vain;<br>
And needful was such strength to these,<br>
Exposed to the tempestuous seas,<br>
Scourged by the winds&rsquo; eternal sway,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  180<br>
Open to rovers fierce as they,<br>
Which could twelve hundred years withstand<br>
Winds, waves, and northern pirates&rsquo; hand.<br>
Not but that portions of the pile,<br>
Rebuilded in a later style,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
185<br>
Show&rsquo;d where the spoiler&rsquo;s hand had been;<br>
Not but the wasting sea-breeze keen<br>
Had worn the pillar&rsquo;s carving quaint,<br>
And moulder&rsquo;d in his niche the saint,<br>
And rounded, with consuming power,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  190<br>
The pointed angles of each tower;<br>
Yet still entire the Abbey stood,<br>
Like veteran, worn, but unsubdued.<br>
<br>
<br>
XI.<br>
<br>
Soon as they near&rsquo;d his turrets strong,<br>
The maidens raised Saint Hilda&rsquo;s song,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  195<br>
And with the sea-wave and the wind,<br>
Their voices, sweetly shrill, combined,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And made harmonious close;<br>
Then, answering from the sandy shore,<br>
Half-drown&rsquo;d amid the breakers&rsquo; roar,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 200<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;According chorus rose:<br>
Down to the haven of the Isle,<br>
The monks and nuns in order file,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From Cuthbert&rsquo;s cloisters grim;<br>
Banner, and cross, and relics there,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  205<br>
To meet Saint Hilda&rsquo;s maids, they bare;<br>
And, as they caught the sounds on air,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They echoed back the hymn.<br>
The islanders, in joyous mood,<br>
Rush&rsquo;d emulously through the flood,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 210<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To hale the bark to land;<br>
Conspicuous by her veil and hood,<br>
Signing the cross, the Abbess stood,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And bless&rsquo;d them with her hand.<br>
<br>
<br>
XII.<br>
<br>
Suppose we now the welcome said,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  215<br>
Suppose the Convent banquet made:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All through the holy dome,<br>
Through cloister, aisle, and gallery,<br>
Wherever vestal maid might pry,<br>
No risk to meet unhallow&rsquo;d eye,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 220<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The stranger sisters roam:<br>
Till fell the evening damp with dew,<br>
And the sharp sea-breeze coldly blew,<br>
For there, even summer night is chill.<br>
Then, having stray&rsquo;d and gazed their fill,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  225<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They closed around the fire;<br>
And all, in turn, essay&rsquo;d to paint<br>
The rival merits of their saint,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A theme that ne&rsquo;er can tire<br>
A holy maid; for, be it known,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  230<br>
That their saint&rsquo;s honour is their own.<br>
<br>
<br>
XIII.<br>
<br>
Then Whitby&rsquo;s nuns exulting told,<br>
How to their house three Barons bold<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Must menial service do;<br>
While horns blow out a note of shame,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 235<br>
And monks cry &lsquo;Fye upon your name!<br>
In wrath, for loss of silvan game,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Hilda&rsquo;s priest ye slew.&rsquo;-<br>
&lsquo;This, on Ascension-day, each year,<br>
While labouring on our harbour-pier,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  240<br>
Must Herbert, Bruce, and Percy hear.&rsquo;-<br>
They told how in their convent-cell<br>
A Saxon princess once did dwell,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The lovely Edelfled;<br>
And how, of thousand snakes, each one&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 245<br>
Was changed into a coil of stone,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When holy Hilda pray&rsquo;d;<br>
Themselves, within their holy bound,<br>
Their stony folds had often found.<br>
They told, how sea-fowls&rsquo; pinions fail,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 250<br>
As over Whitby&rsquo;s towers they sail,<br>
And, sinking down, with flutterings faint,<br>
They do their homage to the saint.<br>
<br>
<br>
XIV.<br>
<br>
Nor did Saint Cuthbert&rsquo;s daughters fail,<br>
To vie with these in holy tale;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 255<br>
His body&rsquo;s resting-place, of old,<br>
How oft their patron changed, they told;<br>
How, when the rude Dane burn&rsquo;d their pile,<br>
The monks fled forth from Holy Isle;<br>
O&rsquo;er northern mountain, marsh, and moor,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  260<br>
From sea to sea, from shore to shore,<br>
Seven years Saint Cuthbert&rsquo;s corpse they bore.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They rested them in fair Melrose;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But though, alive, he loved it well,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not there his relics might repose;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  265<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For, wondrous tale to tell!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In his stone-coffin forth he rides,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A ponderous bark for river tides,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet light as gossamer it glides,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Downward to Tilmouth cell.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;  270<br>
Nor long was his abiding there,<br>
Far southward did the saint repair;<br>
Chester-le-Street, and Rippon, saw<br>
His holy corpse, ere Wardilaw<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hail&rsquo;d him with joy and fear;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; 275<br>
And, after many wanderings past,<br>
He chose his lordly seat at last,<br>
Where his cathedral, huge and vast,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Looks down upon the Wear;<br>
There, deep in Durham&rsquo;s Gothic shade,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 280<br>
His relics are in secret laid;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But none may know the place,<br>
Save of his holiest servants three,<br>
Deep sworn to solemn secrecy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who share that wondrous grace.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  285<br>
<br>
<br>
XV.<br>
<br>
Who may his miracles declare!<br>
Even Scotland&rsquo;s dauntless king, and heir,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Although with them they led<br>
Galwegians, wild as ocean&rsquo;s gale,<br>
And Lodon&rsquo;s knights, all sheathed in mail,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  290<br>
And the bold men of Teviotdale,)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Before his standard fled.<br>
&lsquo;Twas he, to vindicate his reign,<br>
Edged Alfred&rsquo;s falchion on the Dane,<br>
And turn&rsquo;d the Conqueror back again,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  295<br>
When, with his Norman bowyer band,<br>
He came to waste Northumberland.<br>
<br>
<br>
XVI.<br>
<br>
But fain Saint Hilda&rsquo;s nuns would learn<br>
If, on a rock, by Lindisfarne,<br>
Saint Cuthbert sits, and toils to frame&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 300<br>
The sea-born beads that bear his name:<br>
Such tales had Whitby&rsquo;s fishers told,<br>
And said they might his shape behold,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And hear his anvil sound;<br>
A deaden&rsquo;d clang,-a huge dim form,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 305<br>
Seen but, and heard, when gathering storm<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And night were closing round.<br>
But this, as tale of idle fame,<br>
The nuns of Lindisfarne disclaim.<br>
<br>
<br>
XVII.<br>
<br>
While round the fire such legends go,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 310<br>
Far different was the scene of woe,<br>
Where, in a secret aisle beneath,<br>
Council was held of life and death.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It was more dark and lone that vault,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than the worst dungeon cell:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 315<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Colwulf built it, for his fault,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In penitence to dwell,<br>
When he, for cowl and beads, laid down<br>
The Saxon battle-axe and crown.<br>
This den, which, chilling every sense&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 320<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of feeling, hearing, sight,<br>
Was call&rsquo;d the Vault of Penitence,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Excluding air and light,<br>
Was, by the prelate Sexhelm, made<br>
A place of burial for such dead,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  325<br>
As, having died in mortal sin,<br>
Might not be laid the church within.<br>
&lsquo;Twas now a place of punishment;<br>
Whence if so loud a shriek were sent,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As reach&rsquo;d the upper air,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; 330<br>
The hearers bless&rsquo;d themselves, and said,<br>
The spirits of the sinful dead<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bemoan&rsquo;d their torments there.<br>
<br>
<br>
XVIII.<br>
<br>
But though, in the monastic pile,<br>
Did of this penitential aisle&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 335<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some vague tradition go,<br>
Few only, save the Abbot, knew<br>
Where the place lay; and still more few<br>
Were those, who had from him the clew<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To that dread vault to go.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 340<br>
Victim and executioner<br>
Were blindfold when transported there.<br>
In low dark rounds the arches hung,<br>
From the rude rock the side-walls sprung;<br>
The grave-stones, rudely sculptured o&rsquo;er,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 345<br>
Half sunk in earth, by time half wore,<br>
Were all the pavement of the floor;<br>
The mildew-drops fell one by one,<br>
With tinkling plash, upon the stone.<br>
A cresset, in an iron chain,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  350<br>
Which served to light this drear domain,<br>
With damp and darkness seem&rsquo;d to strive,<br>
As if it scarce might keep alive;<br>
And yet it dimly served to show<br>
The awful conclave met below.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 355<br>
<br>
<br>
XIX.<br>
<br>
There, met to doom in secrecy,<br>
Were placed the heads of convents three:<br>
All servants of Saint Benedict,<br>
The statutes of whose order strict<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On iron table lay;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  360<br>
In long black dress, on seats of stone,<br>
Behind were these three judges shown<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By the pale cresset&rsquo;s ray:<br>
The Abbess of Saint Hilda&rsquo;s, there,<br>
Sat for a space with visage bare,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 365<br>
Until, to hide her bosom&rsquo;s swell,<br>
And tear-drops that for pity fell,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She closely drew her veil:<br>
Yon shrouded figure, as I guess,<br>
By her proud mien and flowing dress,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  370<br>
Is Tynemouth&rsquo;s haughty Prioress,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And she with awe looks pale:<br>
And he, that Ancient Man, whose sight<br>
Has long been quench&rsquo;d by age&rsquo;s night,<br>
Upon whose wrinkled brow alone,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 375<br>
Nor ruth, nor mercy&rsquo;s trace, is shown,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose look is hard and stern,-<br>
Saint Cuthbert&rsquo;s Abbot is his style;<br>
For sanctity call&rsquo;d, through the isle,<br>
The Saint of Lindisfarne.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
380<br>
<br>
<br>
XX.<br>
<br>
Before them stood a guilty pair;<br>
But, though an equal fate they share,<br>
Yet one alone deserves our care.<br>
Her sex a page&rsquo;s dress belied;<br>
The cloak and doublet, loosely tied,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  385<br>
Obscured her charms, but could not hide.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her cap down o&rsquo;er her face she drew;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, on her doublet breast,<br>
She tried to hide the badge of blue,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Marmion&rsquo;s falcon crest.&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;  390<br>
But, at the Prioress&rsquo; command,<br>
A Monk undid the silken band<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That tied her tresses fair,<br>
And raised the bonnet from her head,<br>
And down her slender form they spread,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  395<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In ringlets rich and rare.<br>
Constance de Beverley they know,<br>
Sister profess&rsquo;d of Fontevraud,<br>
Whom the Church number&rsquo;d with the dead,<br>
For broken vows, and convent fled.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  400<br>
<br>
<br>
XXI.<br>
<br>
When thus her face was given to view,<br>
(Although so pallid was her hue,<br>
It did a ghastly contrast bear<br>
To those bright ringlets glistering fair),<br>
Her look composed, and steady eye,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  405<br>
Bespoke a matchless constancy;<br>
And there she stood so calm and pale,<br>
That, bur her breathing did not fail,<br>
And motion slight of eye and head,<br>
And of her bosom, warranted&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
410<br>
That neither sense nor pulse she lacks,<br>
You might have thought a form of wax,<br>
Wrought to the very life, was there;<br>
So still she was, so pale, so fair.<br>
<br>

<br>
Her comrade was a sordid soul,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  415<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Such as does murder for a meed;<br>
Who, but of fear, knows no control,<br>
Because his conscience, sear&rsquo;d and foul,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Feels not the import of his deed;<br>
One, whose brute-feeling ne&rsquo;er aspires&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  420<br>
Beyond his own more brute desires.<br>
Such tools the Tempter ever needs,<br>
To do the savagest of deeds;<br>
For them no vision&rsquo;d terrors daunt,<br>
Their nights no fancied spectres haunt,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 425<br>
One fear with them, of all most base,<br>
The fear of death,-alone finds place.<br>
This wretch was clad in frock and cowl,<br>
And &lsquo;shamed not loud to moan and howl,<br>
His body on the floor to dash,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  430<br>
And crouch, like hound beneath the lash;<br>
While his mute partner, standing near,<br>
Waited her doom without a tear.<br>
<br>
<br>
XXIII.<br>
<br>
Yet well the luckless wretch might shriek,<br>
Well might her paleness terror speak!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 435<br>
For there were seen in that dark wall,<br>
Two niches, narrow, deep, and tall;-<br>
Who enters at such grisly door,<br>
Shall ne&rsquo;er, I ween, find exit more.<br>
In each a slender meal was laid,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  440<br>
Of roots, of water, and of bread:<br>
By each, in Benedictine dress,<br>
Two haggard monks stood motionless;<br>
Who, holding high a blazing torch,<br>
Show&rsquo;d the grim entrance of the porch:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  445<br>
Reflecting back the smoky beam,<br>
The dark-red walls and arches gleam.<br>
Hewn stones and cement were display&rsquo;d,<br>
And building tools in order laid.<br>
<br>
<br>
XXIV.<br>
<br>
These executioners were chose,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  450<br>
As men who were with mankind foes,<br>
And with despite and envy fired,<br>
Into the cloister had retired;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or who, in desperate doubt of grace,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Strove, by deep penance, to efface&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  455<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of some foul crime the stain;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For, as the vassals of her will,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Such men the Church selected still,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As either joy&rsquo;d in doing ill,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or thought more grace to gain,&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 460<br>
If, in her cause, they wrestled down<br>
Feelings their nature strove to own.<br>
By strange device were they brought there,<br>
They knew not how, and knew not where.<br>
<br>
<br>
XXV.<br>
<br>
And now that blind old Abbot rose,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  465<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To speak the Chapter&rsquo;s doom,<br>
On those the wall was to enclose,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Alive, within the tomb;<br>
But stopp&rsquo;d, because that woful Maid,<br>
Gathering her powers, to speak essay&rsquo;d.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 470<br>
Twice she essay&rsquo;d, and twice in vain;<br>
Her accents might no utterance gain;<br>
Nought but imperfect murmurs slip<br>
From her convulsed and quivering lip;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Twixt each attempt all was so still,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  475<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You seem&rsquo;d to hear a distant rill-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Twas ocean&rsquo;s swells and falls;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For though this vault of sin and fear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was to the sounding surge so near,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A tempest there you scarce could hear,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  480<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So massive were the walls.<br>
<br>
<br>
XXVI.<br>
<br>
At length, an effort sent apart<br>
The blood that curdled to her heart,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And light came to her eye,<br>
And colour dawn&rsquo;d upon her cheek,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 485<br>
A hectic and a flutter&rsquo;d streak,<br>
Like that left on the Cheviot peak,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By Autumn&rsquo;s stormy sky;<br>
And when her silence broke at length,<br>
Still as she spoke she gather&rsquo;d strength,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 490<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And arm&rsquo;d herself to bear.<br>
It was a fearful sight to see<br>
Such high resolve and constancy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In form so soft and fair.<br>
<br>
<br>
XXVII.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I speak not to implore your grace,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 495<br>
Well know I, for one minute&rsquo;s space<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Successless might I sue:<br>
Nor do I speak your prayers to gain;<br>
For if a death of lingering pain,<br>
To cleanse my sins, be penance vain,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  500<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Vain are your masses too.-<br>
I listen&rsquo;d to a traitor&rsquo;s tale,<br>
I left the convent and the veil;<br>
For three long years I bow&rsquo;d my pride,<br>
A horse-boy in his train to ride;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 505<br>
And well my folly&rsquo;s meed he gave,<br>
Who forfeited, to be his slave,<br>
All here, and all beyond the grave.-<br>
He saw young Clara&rsquo;s face more fair,<br>
He knew her of broad lands the heir,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  510<br>
Forgot his vows, his faith forswore,<br>
And Constance was beloved no more.-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Tis an old tale, and often told;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But did my fate and wish agree,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ne&rsquo;er had been read, in story old,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  515<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of maiden true betray&rsquo;d for gold,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That loved, or was avenged, like me!<br>
<br>
<br>
XXVIII.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;The King approved his favourite&rsquo;s aim;<br>
In vain a rival barr&rsquo;d his claim,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose fate with Clare&rsquo;s was plight,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 520<br>
For he attaints that rival&rsquo;s fame<br>
With treason&rsquo;s charge-and on they came,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In mortal lists to fight.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their oaths are said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their prayers are pray&rsquo;d,&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 525<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their lances in the rest are laid,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They meet in mortal shock;<br>
And hark! the throng, with thundering cry,<br>
Shout &ldquo;Marmion, Marmion I to the sky,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;De Wilton to the block!&rdquo;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  530<br>
Say ye, who preach Heaven shall decide<br>
When in the lists two champions ride,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Say, was Heaven&rsquo;s justice here?<br>
When, loyal in his love and faith,<br>
Wilton found overthrow or death,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  535<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath a traitor&rsquo;s spear?<br>
How false the charge, how true he fell,<br>
This guilty packet best can tell.&rsquo;-<br>
Then drew a packet from her breast,<br>
Paused, gather&rsquo;d voice, and spoke the rest.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 540<br>
<br>
<br>
XXIX.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Still was false Marmion&rsquo;s bridal staid;<br>
To Whitby&rsquo;s convent fled the maid,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The hated match to shun.<br>
&ldquo;Ho! shifts she thus?&rdquo; King Henry cried,<br>
&ldquo;Sir Marmion, she shall be thy bride,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 545<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If she were sworn a nun.&rdquo;<br>
One way remain&rsquo;d-the King&rsquo;s command<br>
Sent Marmion to the Scottish land!<br>
I linger&rsquo;d here, and rescue plann&rsquo;d<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For Clara and for me:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 550<br>
This caitiff Monk, for gold, did swear,<br>
He would to Whitby&rsquo;s shrine repair,<br>
And, by his drugs, my rival fair<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A saint in heaven should be.<br>
But ill the dastard kept his oath,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  555<br>
Whose cowardice has undone us both.<br>
<br>
<br>
XXX.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;And now my tongue the secret tells,<br>
Not that remorse my bosom swells,<br>
But to assure my soul that none<br>
Shall ever wed with Marmion.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  560<br>
Had fortune my last hope betray&rsquo;d,<br>
This packet, to the King convey&rsquo;d,<br>
Had given him to the headsman&rsquo;s stroke,<br>
Although my heart that instant broke.-<br>
Now, men of death, work forth your will,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  565<br>
For I can suffer, and be still;<br>
And come he slow, or come he fast,<br>
It is but Death who comes at last.<br>
<br>
<br>
XXXI.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Yet dread me, from my living tomb,<br>
Ye vassal slaves of bloody Rome!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  570<br>
If Marmion&rsquo;s late remorse should wake,<br>
Full soon such vengeance will he take,<br>
That you shall wish the fiery Dane<br>
Had rather been your guest again.<br>
Behind, a darker hour ascends!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  575<br>
The altars quake, the crosier bends,<br>
The ire of a despotic King<br>
Rides forth upon destruction&rsquo;s wing;<br>
Then shall these vaults, so strong and deep,<br>
Burst open to the sea-winds&rsquo; sweep;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 580<br>
Some traveller then shall find my bones<br>
Whitening amid disjointed stones,<br>
And, ignorant of priests&rsquo; cruelty,<br>
Marvel such relics here should be.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
XXXII.<br>
<br>
Fix&rsquo;d was her look, and stern her air:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  585<br>
Back from her shoulders stream&rsquo;d her hair;<br>
The locks, that wont her brow to shade,<br>
Stared up erectly from her head;<br>
Her figure seem&rsquo;d to rise more high;<br>
Her voice, despair&rsquo;s wild energy&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  590<br>
Had given a tone of prophecy.<br>
Appall&rsquo;d the astonish&rsquo;d conclave sate;<br>
With stupid eyes, the men of fate<br>
Gazed on the light inspired form,<br>
And listen&rsquo;d for the avenging storm;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  595<br>
The judges felt the victim&rsquo;s dread;<br>
No hand was moved, no word was said,<br>
Till thus the Abbot&rsquo;s doom was given,<br>
Raising his sightless balls to heaven:-<br>
&lsquo;Sister, let thy sorrows cease;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 600<br>
Sinful brother, part in peace!&rsquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From that dire dungeon, place of doom,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of execution too, and tomb,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paced forth the judges three;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorrow it were, and shame, to tell&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  605<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher-work that there befell,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When they had glided from the cell<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of sin and misery.<br>
<br>
<br>
XXXIII.<br>
<br>
An hundred winding steps convey<br>
That conclave to the upper day;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 610<br>
But, ere they breathed the fresher air,<br>
They heard the shriekings of despair,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And many a stifled groan:<br>
With speed their upward way they take,<br>
(Such speed as age and fear can make,)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  615<br>
And cross&rsquo;d themselves for terror&rsquo;s sake,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As hurrying, tottering on,<br>
Even in the vesper&rsquo;s heavenly tone,<br>
They seem&rsquo;d to hear a dying groan,<br>
And bade the passing knell to toll&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  620<br>
For welfare of a parting soul.<br>
Slow o&rsquo;er the midnight wave it swung,<br>
Northumbrian rocks in answer rung;<br>
To Warkworth cell the echoes roll&rsquo;d,<br>
His beads the wakeful hermit told,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  625<br>
The Bamborough peasant raised his head,<br>
But slept ere half a prayer he said;<br>
So far was heard the mighty knell,<br>
The stag sprung up on Cheviot Fell,<br>
Spread his broad nostril to the wind,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 630<br>
Listed before, aside, behind,<br>
Then couch&rsquo;d him down beside the hind,<br>
And quaked among the mountain fern,<br>
To hear that sound, so dull and stern.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>INTRODUCTION TO CANTO THIRD</b>.<br>
<br>
<i>TO WILLIAM ERSKINE, ESQ.<br>
<br>
Ashestiel, Ettrick Forest.<br>
<br>
</i>Like April morning clouds, that pass,<br>
With varying shadow, o&rsquo;er the grass,<br>
And imitate, on field and furrow,<br>
Life&rsquo;s chequer&rsquo;d scene of joy and sorrow;<br>
Like streamlet of the mountain north,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5<br>
Now in a torrent racing forth,<br>
Now winding slow its silver train,<br>
And almost slumbering on the plain;<br>
Like breezes of the autumn day,<br>
Whose voice inconstant dies away,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  10<br>
And ever swells again as fast,<br>
When the ear deems its murmur past;<br>
Thus various, my romantic theme<br>
Flits, winds, or sinks, a morning dream.<br>
Yet pleased, our eye pursues the trace&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 15<br>
Of Light and Shade&rsquo;s inconstant race;<br>
Pleased, views the rivulet afar,<br>
Weaving its maze irregular;<br>
And pleased, we listen as the breeze<br>
Heaves its wild sigh through Autumn trees;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 20<br>
Then, wild as cloud, or stream, or gale,<br>
Flow on, flow unconfined, my Tale!<br>
<br>
Need I to thee, dear Erskine, tell<br>
I love the license all too well,<br>
In sounds now lowly, and now strong,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 25<br>
To raise the desultory song?<br>
Oft, when &lsquo;mid such capricious chime,<br>
Some transient fit of lofty rhyme<br>
To thy kind judgment seem&rsquo;d excuse<br>
For many an error of the muse,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 30<br>
Oft hast thou said, &lsquo;If, still misspent,<br>
Thine hours to poetry are lent,<br>
Go, and to tame thy wandering course,<br>
Quaff from the fountain at the source;<br>
Approach those masters, o&rsquo;er whose tomb&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  35<br>
Immortal laurels ever bloom:<br>
Instructive of the feebler bard,<br>
Still from the grave their voice is heard;<br>
From them, and from the paths they show&rsquo;d,<br>
Choose honour&rsquo;d guide and practised road;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  40<br>
Nor ramble on through brake and maze,<br>
With harpers rude of barbarous days.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Or deem&rsquo;st thou not our later time<br>
Yields topic meet for classic rhyme?<br>
Hast thou no elegiac verse&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; 45<br>
For Brunswick&rsquo;s venerable hearse?<br>
What! not a line, a tear, a sigh,<br>
When valour bleeds for liberty?-<br>
Oh, hero of that glorious time,<br>
When, with unrivall&rsquo;d light sublime,-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 50<br>
Though martial Austria, and though all<br>
The might of Russia, and the Gaul,<br>
Though banded Europe stood her foes-<br>
The star of Brandenburgh arose!<br>
Thou couldst not live to see her beam&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  55<br>
For ever quench&rsquo;d in Jena&rsquo;s stream.<br>
Lamented Chief!-it was not given<br>
To thee to change the doom of Heaven,<br>
And crush that dragon in its birth,<br>
Predestined scourge of guilty earth.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 60<br>
Lamented Chief!-not thine the power,<br>
To save in that presumptuous hour,<br>
When Prussia hurried to the field,<br>
And snatch&rsquo;d the spear, but left the shield!<br>
Valour and skill &lsquo;twas thine to try,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 65<br>
And, tried in vain, &lsquo;twas thine to die.<br>
Ill had it seem&rsquo;d thy silver hair<br>
The last, the bitterest pang to share,<br>
For princedoms reft, and scutcheons riven,<br>
And birthrights to usurpers given;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 70<br>
Thy land&rsquo;s, thy children&rsquo;s wrongs to feel,<br>
And witness woes thou could&rsquo;st not heal!<br>
On thee relenting Heaven bestows<br>
For honour&rsquo;d life an honour&rsquo;d close;<br>
And when revolves, in time&rsquo;s sure change,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  75<br>
The hour of Germany&rsquo;s revenge,<br>
When, breathing fury for her sake,<br>
Some new Arminius shall awake,<br>
Her champion, ere he strike, shall come<br>
To whet his sword on BRUNSWICK&rsquo;S tomb,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 80<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Or of the Red-Cross hero teach<br>
Dauntless in dungeon as on breach:<br>
Alike to him the sea, the shore,<br>
The brand, the bridle, or the oar:<br>
Alike to him the war that calls&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  85<br>
Its votaries to the shatter&rsquo;d walls,<br>
Which the grim Turk, besmear&rsquo;d with blood,<br>
Against the Invincible made good;<br>
Or that, whose thundering voice could wake<br>
The silence of the polar lake,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 90<br>
When stubborn Russ, and metal&rsquo;d Swede,<br>
On the warp&rsquo;d wave their death-game play&rsquo;d;<br>
Or that, where Vengeance and Affright<br>
Howl&rsquo;d round the father of the fight,<br>
Who snatch&rsquo;d, on Alexandria&rsquo;s sand,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  95<br>
The conqueror&rsquo;s wreath with dying hand.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Or, if to touch such chord be thine,<br>
Restore the ancient tragic line,<br>
And emulate the notes that rung<br>
From the wild harp, which silent hung&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 100<br>
By silver Avon&rsquo;s holy shore,<br>
Till twice an hundred years roll&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er;<br>
When she, the bold Enchantress, came,<br>
With fearless hand and heart on flame!<br>
From the pale willow snatch&rsquo;d the treasure,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 105<br>
And swept it with a kindred measure,<br>
Till Avon&rsquo;s swans, while rung the grove<br>
With Montfort&rsquo;s hate and Basil&rsquo;s love,<br>
Awakening at the inspired strain,<br>
Deem&rsquo;d their own Shakspeare lived again.&rsquo;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 110<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy friendship thus thy judgment wronging,<br>
With praises not to me belonging,<br>
In task more meet for mightiest powers,<br>
Wouldst thou engage my thriftless hours.<br>
But say, my Erskine, hast thou weigh&rsquo;d&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  115<br>
That secret power by all obey&rsquo;d,<br>
Which warps not less the passive mind,<br>
Its source conceal&rsquo;d or undefined;<br>
Whether an impulse, that has birth<br>
Soon as the infant wakes on earth,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  120<br>
One with our feelings and our powers,<br>
And rather part of us than ours;<br>
Or whether fitlier term&rsquo;d the sway<br>
Of habit, form&rsquo;d in early day?<br>
Howe&rsquo;er derived, its force confest&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  125<br>
Rules with despotic sway the breast,<br>
And drags us on by viewless chain,<br>
While taste and reason plead in vain.<br>
Look east, and ask the Belgian why,<br>
Beneath Batavia&rsquo;s sultry sky,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
130<br>
He seeks not eager to inhale<br>
The freshness of the mountain gale,<br>
Content to rear his whiten&rsquo;d wall<br>
Beside the dank and dull canal?<br>
He&rsquo;ll say, from youth he loved to see&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 135<br>
The white sail gliding by the tree.<br>
Or see yon weatherbeaten hind,<br>
Whose sluggish herds before him wind,<br>
Whose tatter&rsquo;d plaid and rugged cheek<br>
His northern clime and kindred speak;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 140<br>
Through England&rsquo;s laughing meads he goes,<br>
And England&rsquo;s wealth around him flows;<br>
Ask, if it would content him well,<br>
At ease in those gay plains to dwell,<br>
Where hedge-rows spread a verdant screen,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 145<br>
And spires and forests intervene,<br>
And the neat cottage peeps between?<br>
No! not for these will he exchange<br>
His dark Lochaber&rsquo;s boundless range;<br>
Not for fair Devon&rsquo;s meads forsake&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  150<br>
Bennevis grey, and Carry&rsquo;s lake.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus while I ape the measure wild<br>
Of tales that charm&rsquo;d me yet a child,<br>
Rude though they be, still with the chime<br>
Return the thoughts of early time;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  155<br>
And feelings, roused in life&rsquo;s first day,<br>
Glow in the line, and prompt the lay.<br>
Then rise those crags, that mountain tower<br>
Which charm&rsquo;d my fancy&rsquo;s wakening hour.<br>
Though no broad river swept along,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  160<br>
To claim, perchance, heroic song;<br>
Though sigh&rsquo;d no groves in summer gale,<br>
To prompt of love a softer tale;<br>
Though scarce a puny streamlet&rsquo;s speed<br>
Claim&rsquo;d homage from a shepherd&rsquo;s reed;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  165<br>
Yet was poetic impulse given,<br>
By the green hill and clear blue heaven.<br>
It was a barren scene, and wild,<br>
Where naked cliff&rsquo;s were rudely piled;<br>
But ever and anon between&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
170<br>
Lay velvet tufts of loveliest green;<br>
And well the lonely infant knew<br>
Recesses where the wall-flower grew,<br>
And honey-suckle loved to crawl<br>
Up the low crag and ruin&rsquo;d wall.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  175<br>
I deem&rsquo;d such nooks the sweetest shade<br>
The sun in all its round survey&rsquo;d;<br>
And still I thought that shatter&rsquo;d tower<br>
The mightiest work of human power;<br>
And marvell&rsquo;d as the aged hind&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  180<br>
With some strange tale bewitch&rsquo;d my mind,<br>
Of forayers, who, with headlong force,<br>
Down from that strength had spurr&rsquo;d their horse,<br>
Their southern rapine to renew,<br>
Far in the distant Cheviots blue,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 185<br>
And, home returning, fill&rsquo;d the hall<br>
With revel, wassel-rout, and brawl.<br>
Methought that still with trump and clang,<br>
The gateway&rsquo;s broken arches rang;<br>
Methought grim features, seam&rsquo;d with scars,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 190<br>
Glared through the window&rsquo;s rusty bars,<br>
And ever, by the winter hearth,<br>
Old tales I heard of woe or mirth,<br>
Of lovers&rsquo; slights, of ladies&rsquo; charms,<br>
Of witches&rsquo; spells, of warriors&rsquo; arms;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  195<br>
Of patriot battles, won of old<br>
By Wallace wight and Bruce the bold;<br>
Of later fields of feud and fight,<br>
When, pouring from their Highland height,<br>
The Scottish clans, in headlong sway,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 200<br>
Had swept the scarlet ranks away.<br>
While stretch&rsquo;d at length upon the floor,<br>
Again I fought each combat o&rsquo;er,<br>
Pebbles and shells, in order laid,<br>
The mimic ranks of war display&rsquo;d;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 205<br>
And onward still the Scottish Lion bore,<br>
And still the scattered Southron fled before.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, with vain fondness, could I trace,<br>
Anew, each kind familiar face,<br>
That brighten&rsquo;d at our evening fire!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  210<br>
From the thatch&rsquo;d mansion&rsquo;s grey-hair&rsquo;d Sire,<br>
Wise without learning, plain and good,<br>
And sprung of Scotland&rsquo;s gentler blood;<br>
Whose eye, in age, quick, clear, and keen,<br>
Show&rsquo;d what in youth its glance had been;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 215<br>
Whose doom discording neighbours sought,<br>
Content with equity unbought;<br>
To him the venerable Priest,<br>
Our frequent and familiar guest,<br>
Whose life and manners well could paint&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 220<br>
Alike the student and the saint;<br>
Alas! whose speech too oft I broke<br>
With gambol rude and timeless joke:<br>
For I was wayward, bold, and wild,<br>
A self-will&rsquo;d imp, a grandame&rsquo;s child;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  225<br>
But half a plague, and half a jest,<br>
Was still endured, beloved, caress&rsquo;d.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From me, thus nurtured, dost thou ask<br>
The classic poet&rsquo;s well-conn&rsquo;d task?<br>
Nay, Erskine, nay-On the wild hill&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 230<br>
Let the wild heath-bell flourish still;<br>
Cherish the tulip, prune the vine,<br>
But freely let the woodbine twine,<br>
And leave untrimm&rsquo;d the eglantine:<br>
Nay, my friend, nay-Since oft thy praise&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 235<br>
Hath given fresh vigour to my lays;<br>
Since oft thy judgment could refine<br>
My flatten&rsquo;d thought, or cumbrous line;<br>
Still kind, as is thy wont, attend,<br>
And in the minstrel spare the friend.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 240<br>
Though wild as cloud, as stream, as gale,<br>
Flow forth, flow unrestrain&rsquo;d, my Tale!<br>

<br>
THE HOSTEL, OR INN.<br>
<br>
<br>
I.<br>
<br>
The livelong day Lord Marmion rode:<br>
The mountain path the Palmer show&rsquo;d<br>
By glen and streamlet winded still,<br>
Where stunted birches hid the rill.<br>
They might not choose the lowland road,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5<br>
For the Merse forayers were abroad,<br>
Who, fired with hate and thirst of prey,<br>
Had scarcely fail&rsquo;d to bar their way.<br>
Oft on the trampling band, from crown<br>
Of some tall cliff, the deer look&rsquo;d down;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  10<br>
On wing of jet, from his repose<br>
In the deep heath, the black-cock rose;<br>
Sprung from the gorse the timid roe,<br>
Nor waited for the bending bow;<br>
And when the stony path began,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 15<br>
By which the naked peak they wan,<br>
Up flew the snowy ptarmigan.<br>
The noon had long been pass&rsquo;d before<br>
They gain&rsquo;d the height of Lammermoor;<br>
Thence winding down the northern way,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  20<br>
Before them, at the close of day,<br>
Old Gifford&rsquo;s towers and hamlet lay.<br>
<br>
<br>
II.<br>
<br>
No summons calls them to the tower,<br>
To spend the hospitable hour.<br>
To Scotland&rsquo;s camp the Lord was gone;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  25<br>
His cautious dame, in bower alone,<br>
Dreaded her castle to unclose,<br>
So late, to unknown friends or foes.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On through the hamlet as they paced,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Before a porch, whose front was graced&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 30<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With bush and flagon trimly placed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Marmion drew his rein:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The village inn seem&rsquo;d large, though rude;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Its cheerful fire and hearty food<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might well relieve his train.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 35<br>
Down from their seats the horsemen sprung,<br>
With jingling spurs the court-yard rung;<br>
They bind their horses to the stall,<br>
For forage, food, and firing call,<br>
And various clamour fills the hall:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  40<br>
Weighing the labour with the cost,<br>
Toils everywhere the bustling host.<br>
<br>
<br>
III<br>
<br>
Soon, by the chimney&rsquo;s merry blaze,<br>
Through the rude hostel might you gaze;<br>
Might see, where, in dark nook aloof,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  45<br>
The rafters of the sooty roof<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bore wealth of winter cheer;<br>
Of sea-fowl dried, and solands store,<br>
And gammons of the tusky boar,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And savoury haunch of deer.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 50<br>
The chimney arch projected wide;<br>
Above, around it, and beside,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were tools for housewives&rsquo; hand;<br>
Nor wanted, in that martial day,<br>
The implements of Scottish fray,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 55<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The buckler, lance, and brand.<br>
Beneath its shade, the place of state,<br>
On oaken settle Marmion sate,<br>
And view&rsquo;d around the blazing hearth.<br>
His followers mix in noisy mirth;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  60<br>
Whom with brown ale, in jolly tide,<br>
From ancient vessels ranged aside,<br>
Full actively their host supplied.<br>
<br>
<br>
IV.<br>
<br>
Theirs was the glee of martial breast,<br>
And laughter theirs at little jest;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  65<br>
And oft Lord Marmion deign&rsquo;d to aid,<br>
And mingle in the mirth they made;<br>
For though, with men of high degree,<br>
The proudest of the proud was he,<br>
Yet, train&rsquo;d in camps, he knew the art&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 70<br>
To win the soldier&rsquo;s hardy heart.<br>
They love a captain to obey,<br>
Boisterous as March, yet fresh as May;<br>
With open hand, and brow as free,<br>
Lover of wine and minstrelsy;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  75<br>
Ever the first to scale a tower,<br>
As venturous in a lady&rsquo;s bower:-<br>
Such buxom chief shall lead his host<br>
From India&rsquo;s fires to Zembla&rsquo;s frost.<br>
<br>
<br>
V.<br>
<br>
Resting upon his pilgrim staff,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  80<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Right opposite the Palmer stood;<br>
His thin dark visage seen but half,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Half hidden by his hood.<br>
Still fix&rsquo;d on Marmion was his look,<br>
Which he, who ill such gaze could brook,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 85<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Strove by a frown to quell;<br>
But not for that, though more than once<br>
Full met their stern encountering glance,<br>
The Palmer&rsquo;s visage fell.<br>
<br>
<br>
VI.<br>
<br>
By fits less frequent from the crowd&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 90<br>
Was heard the burst of laughter loud;<br>
For still, as squire and archer stared<br>
On that dark face and matted beard,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their glee and game declined.<br>
All gazed at length in silence drear,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  95<br>
Unbroke, save when in comrade&rsquo;s ear<br>
Some yeoman, wondering in his fear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus whispered forth his mind:-<br>
&lsquo;Saint Mary! saw&rsquo;st thou e&rsquo;er such sight?<br>
How pale his cheek, his eye how bright,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 100<br>
Whene&rsquo;er the firebrand&rsquo;s fickle light<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Glances beneath his cowl!<br>
Full on our Lord he sets his eye;<br>
For his best palfrey, would not I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Endure that sullen scowl.&rsquo;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;  105<br>
<br>
<br>
VII.<br>
<br>
But Marmion, as to chase the awe<br>
Which thus had quell&rsquo;d their hearts, who saw<br>
The ever-varying fire-light show<br>
That figure stern and face of woe,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now call&rsquo;d upon a squire:-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; 110<br>
&lsquo;Fitz-Eustace, know&rsquo;st thou not some lay,<br>
To speed the lingering night away?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We slumber by the fire.&rsquo;-<br>
<br>
<br>
VIII.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;So please you,&rsquo; thus the youth rejoin&rsquo;d,<br>
&lsquo;Our choicest minstrel&rsquo;s left behind.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 115<br>
Ill may we hope to please your ear,<br>
Accustom&rsquo;d Constant&rsquo;s strains to hear.<br>
The harp full deftly can he strike,<br>
And wake the lover&rsquo;s lute alike;<br>
To dear Saint Valentine, no thrush&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  120<br>
Sings livelier from a spring-tide bush,<br>
No nightingale her love-lorn tune<br>
More sweetly warbles to the moon.<br>
Woe to the cause, whate&rsquo;er it be,<br>
Detains from us his melody,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
125<br>
Lavish&rsquo;d on rocks, and billows stern,<br>
Or duller monks of Lindisfarne.<br>
Now must I venture as I may,<br>
To sing his favourite roundelay.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
IX.<br>
<br>
A mellow voice Fitz-Eustace had,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  130<br>
The air he chose was wild and sad;<br>
Such have I heard, in Scottish land,<br>
Rise from the busy harvest band,<br>
When falls before the mountaineer,<br>
On Lowland plains, the ripen&rsquo;d ear.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 135<br>
Now one shrill voice the notes prolong,<br>
Now a wild chorus swells the song:<br>
Oft have I listen&rsquo;d, and stood still,<br>
As it came soften&rsquo;d up the hill,<br>
And deem&rsquo;d it the lament of men&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 140<br>
Who languish&rsquo;d for their native glen;<br>
And thought how sad would be such sound,<br>
On Susquehanna&rsquo;s swampy ground,<br>
Kentucky&rsquo;s wood-encumber&rsquo;d brake,<br>
Or wild Ontario&rsquo;s boundless lake,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 145<br>
Where heart-sick exiles, in the strain,<br>
Recall&rsquo;d fair Scotland&rsquo;s hills again!<br>

Song<br>
<br>
Where shall the lover rest,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom the fates sever<br>
From his true maiden&rsquo;s breast,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  150<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Parted for ever?<br>
Where, through groves deep and high,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounds the far billow,<br>
Where early violets die,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the willow.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

There, thy rest shalt thou take,<br>

Never again to wake,<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 170<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Borne down by the flying,<br>
Where mingles war&rsquo;s rattle<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With groans of the dying.<br>

CHORUS.<br>
<i>Eleu loro</i>, &amp;c. There shall he be lying.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;O&rsquo;er the false-hearted;<br>
His warm blood the wolf shall lap,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere life be parted.<br>
Shame and dishonour sit<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By his grave ever;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

Blessing shall hallow it,-<br>
Never, O never.<br>

XII.<br>
<br>
It ceased, the melancholy sound;<br>
And silence sunk on all around.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 185<br>
The air was sad; but sadder still<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It fell on Marmion&rsquo;s ear,<br>
And plain&rsquo;d as if disgrace and ill,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And shameful death, were near.<br>
He drew his mantle past his face,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 190<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Between it and the band,<br>
And rested with his head a space,<br>
Reclining on his hand.<br>
His thoughts I scan not; but I ween,<br>
That, could their import have been seen,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  195<br>
The meanest groom in all the hall,<br>
That e&rsquo;er tied courser to a stall,<br>
Would scarce have wished to be their prey,<br>
For Lutterward and Fontenaye.<br>
<br>
<br>
XIII.<br>
<br>
High minds, of native pride and force,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  200<br>
Most deeply feel thy pangs, Remorse!<br>
Fear, for their scourge, mean villains have,<br>
Thou art the torturer of the brave!<br>
Yet fatal strength they boast to steel<br>
Their minds to bear the wounds they feel,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 205<br>
Even while they writhe beneath the smart<br>
Of civil conflict in the heart.<br>
For soon Lord Marmion raised his head,<br>
And, smiling, to Fitz-Eustace said,<br>
&lsquo;Is it not strange, that, as ye sung,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 210<br>
Seem&rsquo;d in mine ear a death-peal rung,<br>
Such as in nunneries they toll<br>
For some departing sister&rsquo;s soul?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Say, what may this portend?&rsquo;-<br>
Then first the Palmer silence broke,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  215<br>
(The livelong day he had not spoke)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;The death of a dear friend.&rsquo;<br>

<br>
Marmion, whose steady heart and eye<br>
Ne&rsquo;er changed in worst extremity;<br>
Marmion, whose soul could scantly brook,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  220<br>
Even from his King, a haughty look;<br>
Whose accents of command controll&rsquo;d,<br>
In camps, the boldest of the bold-<br>
Thought, look, and utterance fail&rsquo;d him now,<br>
Fall&rsquo;n was his glance, and flush&rsquo;d his brow:&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  225<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For either in the tone,<br>
Or something in the Palmer&rsquo;s look,<br>
So full upon his conscience strook,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That answer he found none.<br>
Thus oft it haps, that when within&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  230<br>
They shrink at sense of secret sin,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A feather daunts the brave;<br>
A fool&rsquo;s wild speech confounds the wise,<br>
And proudest princes vail their eyes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Before their meanest slave.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

<br>
Well might he falter!-By his aid<br>
Was Constance Beverley betray&rsquo;d.<br>
Not that he augur&rsquo;d of the doom,<br>
Which on the living closed the tomb:<br>
But, tired to hear the desperate maid&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 240<br>
Threaten by turns, beseech, upbraid;<br>
And wroth, because, in wild despair,<br>
She practised on the life of Clare;<br>
Its fugitive the Church he gave,<br>
Though not a victim, but a slave;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 245<br>
And deem&rsquo;d restraint in convent strange<br>
Would hide her wrongs, and her revenge,<br>
Himself, proud Henry&rsquo;s favourite peer,<br>
Held Romish thunders idle fear,<br>
Secure his pardon he might hold,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  250<br>
For some slight mulct of penance-gold.<br>
Thus judging, he gave secret way,<br>
When the stern priests surprised their prey.<br>
His train but deem&rsquo;d the favourite page<br>
Was left behind, to spare his age;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  255<br>
Or other if they deem&rsquo;d, none dared<br>
To mutter what he thought and heard:<br>
Woe to the vassal, who durst pry<br>
Into Lord Marmion&rsquo;s privacy!<br>
<br>
<br>
XVI.<br>
<br>
His conscience slept-he deem&rsquo;d her well,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 260<br>
And safe secured in yonder cell;<br>
But, waken&rsquo;d by her favourite lay,<br>
And that strange Palmer&rsquo;s boding say,<br>
That fell so ominous and drear,<br>
Full on the object of his fear,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 265<br>
To aid remorse&rsquo;s venom&rsquo;d throes,<br>
Dark tales of convent-vengeance rose;<br>
And Constance, late betray&rsquo;d and scorn&rsquo;d,<br>
All lovely on his soul return&rsquo;d;<br>
Lovely as when, at treacherous call,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  270<br>
She left her convent&rsquo;s peaceful wall,<br>
Crimson&rsquo;d with shame, with terror mute,<br>
Dreading alike escape, pursuit,<br>
Till love, victorious o&rsquo;er alarms,<br>
Hid fears and blushes in his arms.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  275<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Alas!&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;how changed that mien!<br>
How changed these timid looks have been,<br>
Since years of guilt, and of disguise,<br>
Have steel&rsquo;d her brow, and arm&rsquo;d her eyes!<br>
No more of virgin terror speaks&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 280<br>
The blood that mantles in her cheeks;<br>
Fierce, and unfeminine, are there,<br>
Frenzy for joy, for grief despair;<br>
And I the cause-for whom were given<br>
Her peace on earth, her hopes in heaven!-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  285<br>
Would,&rsquo; thought he, as the picture grows,<br>
&lsquo;I on its stalk had left the rose!<br>
Oh, why should man&rsquo;s success remove<br>
The very charms that wake his love!-<br>
Her convent&rsquo;s peaceful solitude&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 290<br>
Is now a prison harsh and rude;<br>
And, pent within the narrow cell,<br>
How will her spirit chafe and swell!<br>
How brook the stern monastic laws!<br>
The penance how-and I the cause!-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 295<br>
Vigil, and scourge-perchance even worse!&rsquo;-<br>
And twice he rose to cry, &lsquo;To horse!&rsquo;<br>
And twice his Sovereign&rsquo;s mandate came,<br>
Like damp upon a kindling flame;<br>
And twice he thought, &lsquo;Gave I not charge&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  300<br>
She should be safe, though not at large?<br>
They durst not, for their island, shred<br>
One golden ringlet from her head.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
XVIII.<br>
<br>
While thus in Marmion&rsquo;s bosom strove<br>
Repentance and reviving love,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 305<br>
Like whirlwinds, whose contending sway<br>
I&rsquo;ve seen Loch Vennachar obey,<br>
Their Host the Palmer&rsquo;s speech had heard,<br>
And, talkative, took up the word:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Ay, reverend Pilgrim, you, who stray&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 310<br>
From Scotland&rsquo;s simple land away,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To visit realms afar,<br>
Full often learn the art to know<br>
Of future weal, or future woe,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By word, or sign, or star;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 315<br>
Yet might a knight his fortune hear,<br>
If, knight-like, he despises fear,<br>
Not far from hence;-if fathers old<br>
Aright our hamlet legend told.&rsquo;-<br>
These broken words the menials move,<br>
(For marvels still the vulgar love,)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  320<br>
And, Marmion giving license cold,<br>
His tale the host thus gladly told:-<br>
<br>
<br>
XIX.<br>
<br>
The Host&rsquo;s Tale<br>
<br>
&lsquo;A Clerk could tell what years have flown<br>
Since Alexander fill&rsquo;d our throne,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  325<br>
(Third monarch of that warlike name,)<br>
And eke the time when here he came<br>
To seek Sir Hugo, then our lord:<br>
A braver never drew a sword;<br>
A wiser never, at the hour&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 330<br>
Of midnight, spoke the word of power:<br>
The same, whom ancient records call<br>
The founder of the Goblin-Hall.<br>
I would, Sir Knight, your longer stay<br>
Gave you that cavern to survey.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 335<br>
Of lofty roof, and ample size,<br>
Beneath the castle deep it lies:<br>
To hew the living rock profound,<br>
The floor to pave, the arch to round,<br>
There never toil&rsquo;d a mortal arm,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  340<br>
It all was wrought by word and charm;<br>
And I have heard my grandsire say,<br>
That the wild clamour and affray<br>
Of those dread artisans of hell,<br>
Who labour&rsquo;d under Hugo&rsquo;s spell,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  345<br>
Sounded as loud as ocean&rsquo;s war,<br>
Among the caverns of Dunbar.<br>
<br>
<br>
XX.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;The King Lord Gifford&rsquo;s castle sought,<br>
Deep labouring with uncertain thought;<br>
Even then he mustered all his host,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 350<br>
To meet upon the western coast;<br>
For Norse and Danish galleys plied<br>
Their oars within the Frith of Clyde.<br>
There floated Haco&rsquo;s banner trim,<br>
Above Norweyan warriors grim,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 355<br>
Savage of heart, and large of limb;<br>
Threatening both continent and isle,<br>
Bute, Arran, Cunninghame, and Kyle.<br>
Lord Gifford, deep beneath the ground,<br>
Heard Alexander&rsquo;s bugle sound,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  360<br>
And tarried not his garb to change,<br>
But, in his wizard habit strange,<br>
Came forth,-a quaint and fearful sight;<br>
His mantle lined with fox-skins white;<br>
His high and wrinkled forehead bore&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 365<br>
A pointed cap, such as of yore<br>
Clerks say that Pharaoh&rsquo;s Magi wore:<br>
His shoes were mark&rsquo;d with cross and spell,<br>
Upon his breast a pentacle;<br>
His zone, of virgin parchment thin,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 370<br>
Or, as some tell, of dead man&rsquo;s skin,<br>
Bore many a planetary sign,<br>
Combust, and retrograde, and trine;<br>
And in his hand he held prepared,<br>
A naked sword without a guard.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  375<br>
<br>
<br>
XXI.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Dire dealings with the fiendish race<br>
Had mark&rsquo;d strange lines upon his face;<br>
Vigil and fast had worn him grim,<br>
His eyesight dazzled seem&rsquo;d and dim,<br>
As one unused to upper day;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
380<br>
Even his own menials with dismay<br>
Beheld, Sir Knight, the grisly Sire,<br>
In his unwonted wild attire;<br>
Unwonted, for traditions run,<br>
He seldom thus beheld the sun.-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  385<br>
&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he said,-his voice was hoarse,<br>
And broken seem&rsquo;d its hollow force,-<br>
&ldquo;I know the cause, although untold,<br>
Why the King seeks his vassal&rsquo;s hold:<br>
Vainly from me my liege would know&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  390<br>
His kingdom&rsquo;s future weal or woe;<br>
But yet, if strong his arm and heart,<br>
His courage may do more than art.<br>
<br>
<br>
XXII.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;&ldquo;Of middle air the demons proud,<br>
Who ride upon the racking cloud,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  395<br>
Can read, in fix&rsquo;d or wandering star,<br>
The issue of events afar;<br>
But still their sullen aid withhold,<br>
Save when by mightier force controll&rsquo;d.<br>
Such late I summon&rsquo;d to my hall;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  400<br>
And though so potent was the call,<br>
That scarce the deepest nook of hell<br>
I deem&rsquo;d a refuge from the spell,<br>
Yet, obstinate in silence still,<br>
The haughty demon mocks my skill.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 405<br>
But thou,-who little know&rsquo;st thy might,<br>
As born upon that blessed night<br>
When yawning graves, and dying groan,<br>
Proclaim&rsquo;d hell&rsquo;s empire overthrown,-<br>
With untaught valour shalt compel&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 410<br>
Response denied to magic spell.&rdquo;-<br>
&ldquo;Gramercy,&rdquo; quoth our Monarch free,<br>
&ldquo;Place him but front to front with me,<br>
And, by this good and honour&rsquo;d brand,<br>
The gift of Coeur-de-Lion&rsquo;s hand,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 415<br>
Soothly I swear, that, tide what tide,<br>
The demon shall a buffet bide.&rdquo;-<br>
His bearing bold the wizard view&rsquo;d,<br>
And thus, well pleased, his speech renew&rsquo;d:-<br>
&ldquo;There spoke the blood of Malcolm!-mark:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 420<br>
Forth pacing hence, at midnight dark,<br>
The rampart seek, whose circling crown<br>
Crests the ascent of yonder down:<br>
A southern entrance shalt thou find;<br>
There halt, and there thy bugle wind,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 425<br>
And trust thine elfin foe to see,<br>
In guise of thy worst enemy:<br>
Couch then thy lance, and spur thy steed-<br>
Upon him! and Saint George to speed!<br>
If he go down, thou soon shalt know&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 430<br>
Whate&rsquo;er these airy sprites can show:-<br>
If thy heart fail thee in the strife,<br>
I am no warrant for thy life.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
XXIII.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Soon as the midnight bell did ring,<br>
Alone, and arm&rsquo;d, forth rode the King&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 435<br>
To that old camp&rsquo;s deserted round:<br>
Sir Knight, you well might mark the mound,<br>
Left hand the town,-the Pictish race,<br>
The trench, long since, in blood did trace;<br>
The moor around is brown and bare,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  440<br>
The space within is green and fair.<br>
The spot our village children know,<br>
For there the earliest wild-flowers grow;<br>
But woe betide the wandering wight,<br>
That treads its circle in the night!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  445<br>
The breadth across, a bowshot clear,<br>
Gives ample space for full career;<br>
Opposed to the four points of heaven,<br>
By four deep gaps are entrance given.<br>
The southernmost our Monarch past,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  450<br>
Halted, and blew a gallant blast;<br>
And on the north, within the ring,<br>
Appeared the form of England&rsquo;s King,<br>
Who then a thousand leagues afar,<br>
In Palestine waged holy war:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  455<br>
Yet arms like England&rsquo;s did he wield,<br>
Alike the leopards in the shield,<br>
Alike his Syrian courser&rsquo;s frame,<br>
The rider&rsquo;s length of limb the same:<br>
Long afterwards did Scotland know,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  460<br>
Fell Edward was her deadliest foe.<br>
<br>
<br>
XXIV.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;The vision made our Monarch start,<br>
But soon he mann&rsquo;d his noble heart,<br>
And in the first career they ran,<br>
The Elfin Knight fell, horse and man;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 465<br>
Yet did a splinter of his lance<br>
Through Alexander&rsquo;s visor glance,<br>
And razed the skin-a puny wound.<br>
The King, light leaping to the ground,<br>
With naked blade his phantom foe&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  470<br>
Compell&rsquo;d the future war to show.<br>
Of Largs he saw the glorious plain,<br>
Where still gigantic bones remain,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Memorial of the Danish war;<br>
Himself he saw, amid the field,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 475<br>
On high his brandish&rsquo;d war-axe wield,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And strike proud Haco from his car,<br>
While all around the shadowy Kings<br>
Denmark&rsquo;s grim ravens cower&rsquo;d their wings.<br>
&lsquo;Tis said, that, in that awful night,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 480<br>
Remoter visions met his sight,<br>
Foreshowing future conquest far,<br>
When our sons&rsquo; sons wage northern war;<br>
A royal city, tower and spire,<br>
Redden&rsquo;d the midnight sky with fire,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  485<br>
And shouting crews her navy bore,<br>
Triumphant, to the victor shore.<br>
Such signs may learned clerks explain,<br>
They pass the wit of simple swain.<br>
<br>
<br>
XXV.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;The joyful King turn&rsquo;d home again,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 490<br>
Headed his host, and quell&rsquo;d the Dane;<br>
But yearly, when return&rsquo;d the night<br>
Of his strange combat with the sprite,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His wound must bleed and smart;<br>
Lord Gifford then would gibing say,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 495<br>
&ldquo;Bold as ye were, my liege, ye pay<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The penance of your start.&rdquo;<br>
Long since, beneath Dunfermline&rsquo;s nave,<br>
King Alexander fills his grave,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Lady give him rest!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; 500<br>
Yet still the knightly spear and shield<br>
The Elfin Warrior doth wield,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the brown hill&rsquo;s breast;<br>
And many a knight hath proved his chance,<br>
In the charm&rsquo;d ring to break a lance,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 505<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But all have foully sped;<br>
Save two, as legends tell, and they<br>
Were Wallace wight, and Gilbert Hay.-<br>
Gentles, my tale is said.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
XXVI.<br>
<br>
The quaighs were deep, the liquor strong,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 510<br>
And on the tale the yeoman-throng<br>
Had made a comment sage and long,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But Marmion gave a sign:<br>
And, with their lord, the squires retire;<br>
The rest around the hostel fire,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  515<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their drowsy limbs recline:<br>
For pillow, underneath each head,<br>
The quiver and the targe were laid.<br>
Deep slumbering on the hostel floor,<br>
Oppress&rsquo;d with toil and ale, they snore:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  520<br>
The dying flame, in fitful change,<br>
Threw on the group its shadows strange.<br>
<br>
<br>
XXVII.<br>
<br>
Apart, and nestling in the hay<br>
Of a waste loft, Fitz-Eustace lay;<br>
Scarce, by the pale moonlight, were seen&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  525<br>
The foldings of his mantle green:<br>
Lightly he dreamt, as youth will dream,<br>
Of sport by thicket, or by stream,<br>
Of hawk or hound, of ring or glove,<br>
Or, lighter yet, of lady&rsquo;s love.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  530<br>
A cautious tread his slumber broke,<br>
And, close beside him, when he woke,<br>
In moonbeam half, and half in gloom,<br>
Stood a tall form, with nodding plume;<br>
But, ere his dagger Eustace drew,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 535<br>
His master Marmion&rsquo;s voice he knew.<br>
<br>
<br>
XXVIII.<br>
<br>
-&lsquo;Fitz-Eustace! rise,-I cannot rest;<br>
Yon churl&rsquo;s wild legend haunts my breast,<br>
And graver thoughts have chafed my mood:<br>
The air must cool my feverish blood;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  540<br>
And fain would I ride forth, to see<br>
The scene of elfin chivalry.<br>
Arise, and saddle me my steed;<br>
And, gentle Eustace, take good heed<br>
Thou dost not rouse these drowsy slaves;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  545<br>
I would not, that the prating knaves<br>
Had cause for saying, o&rsquo;er their ale,<br>
That I could credit such a tale.&rsquo;-<br>
Then softly down the steps they slid,<br>
Eustace the stable door undid,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  550<br>
And, darkling, Marmion&rsquo;s steed array&rsquo;d,<br>
While, whispering, thus the Baron said:-<br>
<br>
<br>
XXIX.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Did&rsquo;st never, good my youth, hear tell,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That on the hour when I was born,<br>
Saint George, who graced my sire&rsquo;s chapelle,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  555<br>
Down from his steed of marble fell,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A weary wight forlorn?<br>
The flattering chaplains all agree,<br>
The champion left his steed to me.<br>
I would, the omen&rsquo;s truth to show,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  560<br>
That I could meet this Elfin Foe!<br>
Blithe would I battle, for the right<br>
To ask one question at the sprite:<br>
Vain thought! for elves, if elves there be,<br>
An empty race, by fount or sea,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 565<br>
To dashing waters dance and sing,<br>
Or round the green oak wheel their ring.&rsquo;<br>
Thus speaking, he his steed bestrode,<br>
And from the hostel slowly rode.<br>
<br>
<br>
XXX.<br>
<br>
Fitz-Eustace follow&rsquo;d him abroad,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 570<br>
And mark&rsquo;d him pace the village road,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And listen&rsquo;d to his horse&rsquo;s tramp,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till, by the lessening sound,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He judged that of the Pictish camp<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Marmion sought the round.&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 575<br>
Wonder it seem&rsquo;d, in the squire&rsquo;s eyes,<br>
That one, so wary held, and wise,--<br>
Of whom &lsquo;twas said, he scarce received<br>
For gospel, what the Church believed,-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Should, stirr&rsquo;d by idle tale,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; 580<br>
Ride forth in silence of the night,<br>
As hoping half to meet a sprite,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Array&rsquo;d in plate and mail.<br>
For little did Fitz-Eustace know,<br>
That passions, in contending flow,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  585<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfix the strongest mind;<br>
Wearied from doubt to doubt to flee,<br>
We welcome fond credulity,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Guide confident, though blind.<br>
<br>
<br>
XXXI.<br>
<br>
Little for this Fitz-Eustace cared,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 590<br>
But, patient, waited till he heard,<br>
At distance, prick&rsquo;d to utmost speed,<br>
The foot-tramp of a flying steed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Come town-ward rushing on;<br>
First, dead, as if on turf it trode,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  595<br>
Then, clattering on the village road,-<br>
In other pace than forth he yode,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Return&rsquo;d Lord Marmion.<br>
Down hastily he sprung from selle,<br>
And, in his haste, wellnigh he fell;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  600<br>
To the squire&rsquo;s hand the rein he threw,<br>
And spoke no word as he withdrew:<br>
But yet the moonlight did betray,<br>
The falcon-crest was soil&rsquo;d with clay;<br>
And plainly might Fitz-Eustace see,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 605<br>
By stains upon the charger&rsquo;s knee,<br>
And his left side, that on the moor<br>
He had not kept his footing sure.<br>
Long musing on these wondrous signs,<br>
At length to rest the squire reclines,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  610<br>
Broken and short; for still, between,<br>
Would dreams of terror intervene:<br>
Eustace did ne&rsquo;er so blithely mark<br>
The first notes of the morning lark.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>INTRODUCTION TO CANTO FOURTH</b>.<br>
<br>
<i>TO JAMES SKENE, ESQ.<br>
<br>
Ashestiel, Ettrick Forest</i>.<br>
<br>
An ancient Minstrel sagely said,<br>
&lsquo;Where is the life which late we led?&rsquo;<br>
That motley clown in Arden wood,<br>
Whom humorous Jacques with envy view&rsquo;d,<br>
Not even that clown could amplify,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  5<br>
On this trite text, so long as I.<br>
Eleven years we now may tell,<br>
Since we have known each other well;<br>
Since, riding side by side, our hand<br>
First drew the voluntary brand;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  10<br>
And sure, through many a varied scene,,<br>
Unkindness never came between.<br>
Away these winged years have flown,<br>
To join the mass of ages gone;<br>
And though deep mark&rsquo;d, like all below,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  15<br>
With chequer&rsquo;d shades of joy and woe;<br>
Though thou o&rsquo;er realms and seas hast ranged,<br>
Mark&rsquo;d cities lost, and empires changed,<br>
While here, at home, my narrower ken<br>
Somewhat of manners saw, and men;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  20<br>
Though varying wishes, hopes, and fears,<br>
Fever&rsquo;d the progress of these years,<br>
Vet now, days, weeks, and months, but seem<br>
The recollection of a dream,<br>
So still we glide down to the sea&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  25<br>
Of fathomless eternity.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Even now it scarcely seems a day,<br>
Since first I tuned this idle lay;<br>
A task so often&rsquo; thrown aside,<br>
When leisure graver cares denied,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  30<br>
That now, November&rsquo;s dreary gale,<br>
Whose voice inspired my opening tale,<br>
That same November gale once more<br>
Whirls the dry leaves on Yarrow shore.<br>
Their vex&rsquo;d boughs streaming to the sky,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 35<br>
Once more our naked birches sigh,<br>
And Blackhouse heights, and Ettrick Pen,<br>
Have donn&rsquo;d their wintry shrouds again:<br>
And mountain dark, and flooded mead,<br>
Bid us forsake the banks of Tweed.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 40<br>
Earlier than wont along the sky,<br>
Mix&rsquo;d with the rack, the snow mists fly;<br>
The shepherd who, in summer sun,<br>
Had something of our envy won,<br>
As thou with pencil, I with pen,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 45<br>
The features traced of hill and glen;-<br>
He who, outstretch&rsquo;d the livelong day,<br>
At ease among the heath-flowers lay,<br>
View&rsquo;d the light clouds with vacant look,<br>
Or slumber&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er his tatter&rsquo;d book,&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
50<br>
Or idly busied him to guide<br>
His angle o&rsquo;er the lessen&rsquo;d tide;-<br>
At midnight now, the snowy plain<br>
Finds sterner labour for the swain.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When red hath set the beamless sun,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  55<br>
Through heavy vapours dark and dun;<br>
When the tired ploughman, dry and warm,<br>
Hears, half asleep, the rising storm<br>
Hurling the hail, and sleeted rain,<br>
Against the casement&rsquo;s tinkling pane;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  60<br>
The sounds that drive wild deer, and fox,<br>
To shelter in the brake and rocks,<br>
Are warnings which the shepherd ask<br>
To dismal and to dangerous task.<br>
Oft he looks forth, and hopes, in vain,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  65<br>
The blast may sink in mellowing rain;<br>
Till, dark above, and white below,<br>
Decided drives the flaky snow,<br>
And forth the hardy swain must go.<br>
Long, with dejected look and whine,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  70<br>
To leave the hearth his dogs repine;<br>
Whistling and cheering them to aid,<br>
Around his back he wreathes the plaid:<br>
His flock he gathers, and he guides,<br>
To open downs, and mountain-sides,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 75<br>
Where fiercest though the tempest blow,<br>
Least deeply lies the drift below.<br>
The blast, that whistles o&rsquo;er the fells,<br>
Stiffens his locks to icicles;<br>
Oft he looks back, while streaming far,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  80<br>
His cottage window seems a star,-<br>
Loses its feeble gleam,-and then<br>
Turns patient to the blast again,<br>
And, facing to the tempest&rsquo;s sweep,<br>
Drives through the gloom his lagging sheep.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  85<br>
If fails his heart, if his limbs fail,<br>
Benumbing death is in the gale;<br>
His paths, his landmarks, all unknown,<br>
Close to the hut, no more his own,<br>
Close to the aid he sought in vain,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  90<br>
The morn may find the stiffen&rsquo;d swain:<br>
The widow sees, at dawning pale,<br>
His orphans raise their feeble wail;<br>
And, close beside him, in the snow,<br>
Poor Yarrow, partner of their woe,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 95<br>
Couches upon his master&rsquo;s breast,<br>
And licks his cheek to break his rest.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who envies now the shepherd&rsquo;s lot,<br>
His healthy fare, his rural cot,<br>
His summer couch by greenwood tree,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 100<br>
His rustic kirn&rsquo;s loud revelry,<br>
His native hill-notes, tuned on high,<br>
To Marion of the blithesome eye;<br>
His crook, his scrip, his oaten reed,<br>
And all Arcadia&rsquo;s golden creed?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 105<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes not so with us, my Skene,<br>
Of human life the varying scene?<br>
Our youthful summer oft we see<br>
Dance by on wings of game and glee,<br>
While the dark storm reserves its rage,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 110<br>
Against the winter of our age:<br>
As he, the ancient Chief of Troy,<br>
His manhood spent in peace and joy;<br>
But Grecian fires, and loud alarms,<br>
Call&rsquo;d ancient Priam forth to arms.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 115<br>
Then happy those, since each must drain<br>
His share of pleasure, share of pain,-<br>
Then happy those, beloved of Heaven,<br>
To whom the mingled cup is given;<br>
Whose lenient sorrows find relief,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  120<br>
Whose joys are chasten&rsquo;d by their grief.<br>
And such a lot, my Skene, was thine,<br>
When thou, of late, wert doom&rsquo;d to twine,--<br>
Just when thy bridal hour was by,-<br>
The cypress with the myrtle tie.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  125<br>
Just on thy bride her Sire had smiled,<br>
And bless&rsquo;d the union of his child,<br>
When love must change its joyous cheer,<br>
And wipe affection&rsquo;s filial tear.<br>
Nor did the actions next his end,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 130<br>
Speak more the father than the friend:<br>
Scarce had lamented Forbes paid<br>
The tribute to his Minstrel&rsquo;s shade;<br>
The tale of friendship scarce was told,<br>
Ere the narrator&rsquo;s heart was cold-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 135<br>
Far may we search before we find<br>
A heart so manly and so kind!<br>
But not around his honour&rsquo;d urn,<br>
Shall friends alone and kindred mourn;<br>
The thousand eyes his care had dried,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 140<br>
Pour at his name a bitter tide;<br>
And frequent falls the grateful dew,<br>
For benefits the world ne&rsquo;er knew.<br>
If mortal charity dare claim<br>
The Almighty&rsquo;s attributed name,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 145<br>
Inscribe above his mouldering clay,<br>
&lsquo;The widow&rsquo;s shield, the orphan&rsquo;s stay.&rsquo;<br>
Nor, though it wake thy sorrow, deem<br>
My verse intrudes on this sad theme;<br>
for sacred was the pen that wrote,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  150<br>
&lsquo;Thy father&rsquo;s friend forget thou not:&rsquo;<br>
And grateful title may I plead,<br>
For many a kindly word and deed,<br>
To bring my tribute to his grave:-<br>
&lsquo;Tis little-but &lsquo;tis all I have.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 155<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To thee, perchance, this rambling strain<br>
Recalls our summer walks again;<br>
When, doing nought,-and, to speak true,<br>
Not anxious to find aught to do,-<br>
The wild unbounded hills we ranged,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 160<br>
While oft our talk its topic changed,<br>
And, desultory as our way,<br>
Ranged, unconfined, from grave to gay.<br>
Even when it flagged, as oft will chance,<br>
No effort made to break its trance,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 165<br>
We could right pleasantly pursue<br>
Our sports in social silence too;<br>
Thou gravely labouring to pourtray<br>
The blighted oak&rsquo;s fantastic spray;<br>
I spelling o&rsquo;er, with much delight,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 170<br>
The legend of that antique knight,<br>
Tirante by name, yclep&rsquo;d the White.<br>
At either&rsquo;s feet a trusty squire,<br>
Pandour and Camp, with eyes of fire,<br>
Jealous, each other&rsquo;s motions view&rsquo;d,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 175<br>
And scarce suppress&rsquo;d their ancient feud.<br>
The laverock whistled from the cloud;<br>
The stream was lively, but not loud;<br>
From the white thorn the May-flower shed<br>
Its dewy fragrance round our head:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  180<br>
Not Ariel lived more merrily<br>
Under the blossom&rsquo;d bough, than we.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And blithesome nights, too, have been ours,<br>
When Winter stript the summer&rsquo;s bowers.<br>
Careless we heard, what now I hear,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 185<br>
The wild blast sighing deep and drear,<br>
When fires were bright, and lamps beam&rsquo;d gay,<br>
And ladies tuned the lovely lay;<br>
And he was held a laggard soul,<br>
Who shunn&rsquo;d to quaff the sparkling bowl.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  190<br>
Then he, whose absence we deplore,<br>
Who breathes the gales of Devon&rsquo;s shore,<br>
The longer miss&rsquo;d, bewail&rsquo;d the more;<br>
And thou, and I, and dear-loved R-,<br>
And one whose name I may not say,-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 195<br>
For not Mimosa&rsquo;s tender tree<br>
Shrinks sooner from the touch than he,-<br>
In merry chorus well combined,<br>
With laughter drown&rsquo;d the whistling wind.<br>
Mirth was within; and care without&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  200<br>
Might gnaw her nails to hear our shout.<br>
Not but amid the buxom scene<br>
Some grave discourse might intervene-<br>
Of the good horse that bore him best,<br>
His shoulder, hoof, and arching crest:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  205<br>
For, like mad Tom&rsquo;s, our chiefest care,<br>
Was horse to ride, and weapon wear.<br>
Such nights we&rsquo;ve had; and, though the game<br>
Of manhood be more sober tame,<br>
And though the field-day, or the drill,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 210<br>
Seem less important now-yet still<br>
Such may we hope to share again.<br>
The sprightly thought inspires my strain!<br>
And mark, how, like a horseman true,<br>
Lord Marmion&rsquo;s march I thus renew.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  215<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>CANTO FOURTH</b>.<br>
<br>
THE CAMP.<br>
<br>
<br>
Eustace, I said, did blithely mark<br>
The first notes of the merry lark.<br>
The lark sang shrill, the cock he crew,<br>
And loudly Marmion&rsquo;s bugles blew,<br>
And with their light and lively call,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5<br>
Brought groom and yeoman to the stall.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whistling they came, and free of heart,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But soon their mood was changed;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Complaint was heard on every part,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of something disarranged.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  10<br>
Some clamour&rsquo;d loud for armour lost;<br>
Some brawl&rsquo;d and wrangled with the host;<br>
&lsquo;By Becket&rsquo;s bones,&rsquo; cried one, &lsquo;I fear,<br>
That some false Scot has stolen my spear!&rsquo;-<br>
Young Blount, Lord Marmion&rsquo;s second squire,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  15<br>
Found his steed wet with sweat and mire;<br>
Although the rated horse-boy sware,<br>
Last night he dress&rsquo;d him sleek and fair.<br>
While chafed the impatient squire like thunder,<br>
Old Hubert shouts, in fear and wonder,-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 20<br>
&lsquo;Help, gentle Blount! help, comrades all!<br>
Bevis lies dying in his stall:<br>
To Marmion who the plight dare tell,<br>
Of the good steed he loves so well?&rsquo;-<br>
Gaping for fear and ruth, they saw&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 25<br>
The charger panting on his straw;<br>
Till one, who would seem wisest, cried,-<br>
&lsquo;What else but evil could betide,<br>
With that cursed Palmer for our guide?<br>
Better we had through mire and bush&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  30<br>
Been lantern-led by Friar Rush.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
II.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fitz-Eustace, who the cause but guess&rsquo;d,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor wholly understood,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His comrades&rsquo; clamorous plaints suppress&rsquo;d;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knew Lord Marmion&rsquo;s mood.&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; 35<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Him, ere he issued forth, he sought,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And found deep plunged in gloomy thought,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And did his tale display<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Simply, as if he knew of nought<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cause such disarray.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  40<br>
Lord Marmion gave attention cold,<br>
Nor marvell&rsquo;d at the wonders told,-<br>
Pass&rsquo;d them as accidents of course,<br>
And bade his clarions sound to horse.<br>
<br>
<br>
III.<br>
<br>
Young Henry Blount, meanwhile, the cost&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  45<br>
Had reckon&rsquo;d with their Scottish host;<br>
And, as the charge he cast and paid,<br>
&lsquo;Ill thou deservest thy hire,&rsquo; he said;<br>
&lsquo;Dost see, thou knave, my horse&rsquo;s plight?<br>
Fairies have ridden him all the night,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 50<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And left him in a foam!<br>
I trust, that soon a conjuring band,<br>
With English cross, and blazing brand,<br>
Shall drive the devils from this land,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To their infernal home:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  55<br>
For in this haunted den, I trow,<br>
All night they trampled to and fro.&rsquo;-<br>
The laughing host look&rsquo;d on the hire,-<br>
&lsquo;Gramercy, gentle southern squire,<br>
And if thou comest among the rest,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 60<br>
With Scottish broadsword to be blest,<br>
Sharp be the brand, and sure the blow,<br>
And short the pang to undergo.&rsquo;<br>
Here stay&rsquo;d their talk,-for Marmion<br>
Gave now the signal to set on.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 65<br>
The Palmer showing forth the way,<br>
They journey&rsquo;d all the morning day.<br>
<br>
<br>
IV.<br>
<br>
The green-sward way was smooth and good,<br>
Through Humbie&rsquo;s and through Saltoun&rsquo;s wood;<br>
A forest-glade, which, varying still,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  70<br>
Here gave a view of dale and hill,<br>
There narrower closed, till over head<br>
A vaulted screen the branches made.<br>
&lsquo;A pleasant path,&rsquo; Fitz-Eustace said;<br>
&lsquo;Such as where errant-knights might see&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  75<br>
Adventures of high chivalry;<br>
Might meet some damsel flying fast,<br>
With hair unbound, and looks aghast;<br>
And smooth and level course were here,<br>
In her defence to break a spear.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 80<br>
Here, too, are twilight nooks and dells;<br>
And oft, in such, the story tells,<br>
The damsel kind, from danger freed,<br>
Did grateful pay her champion&rsquo;s meed.&rsquo;<br>
He spoke to cheer Lord Marmion&rsquo;s mind;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 85<br>
Perchance to show his lore design&rsquo;d;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For Eustace much had pored<br>
Upon a huge romantic tome,<br>
In the hall-window of his home,<br>
Imprinted at the antique dome&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  90<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Caxton, or de Worde.<br>
Therefore he spoke,-but spoke in vain,<br>
For Marmion answer&rsquo;d nought again.<br>
<br>
<br>
V.<br>
<br>
Now sudden, distant trumpets shrill,<br>
In notes prolong&rsquo;d by wood and hill,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 95<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were heard to echo far;<br>
Each ready archer grasp&rsquo;d his bow,<br>
But by the flourish soon they know,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They breathed no point of war.<br>
Yet cautious, as in foeman&rsquo;s land,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  100<br>
Lord Marmion&rsquo;s order speeds the band,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some opener ground to gain;<br>
And scarce a furlong had they rode,<br>
When thinner trees, receding, show&rsquo;d<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A little woodland plain.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;  105<br>
Just in that advantageous glade,<br>
The halting troop a line had made,<br>
As forth from the opposing shade<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Issued a gallant train.<br>
<br>
<br>
VI.<br>
<br>
First came the trumpets, at whose clang&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 110<br>
So late the forest echoes rang;<br>
On prancing steeds they forward press&rsquo;d,<br>
With scarlet mantle, azure vest;<br>
Each at his trump a banner wore,<br>
Which Scotland&rsquo;s royal scutcheon bore:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  115<br>
Heralds and pursuivants, by name<br>
Bute, Islay, Marchmount, Rothsay, came,<br>
In painted tabards, proudly showing<br>
Gules, Argent, Or, and Azure glowing,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Attendant on a King-at-arms,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 120<br>
Whose hand the armorial truncheon held,<br>
That feudal strife had often quell&rsquo;d,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When wildest its alarms.<br>
<br>
<br>
VII.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a man of middle age;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In aspect manly, grave, and sage,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 125<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As on King&rsquo;s errand come;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the glances of his eye,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A penetrating, keen, and sly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expression found its home;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The flash of that satiric rage,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 130<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which, bursting on the early stage,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Branded the vices of the age,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And broke the keys of Rome.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On milk-white palfrey forth he paced;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His cap of maintenance was graced&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 135<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the proud heron-plume.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From his steed&rsquo;s shoulder, loin, and breast,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silk housings swept the ground,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With Scotland&rsquo;s arms, device, and crest,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Embroider&rsquo;d round and round.&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;  140<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The double tressure might you see,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First by Achaius borne,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The thistle and the fleur-de-lis,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gallant unicorn.<br>
So bright the King&rsquo;s armorial coat,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 145<br>
That scarce the dazzled eye could note,<br>
In living colours, blazon&rsquo;d brave,<br>
The Lion, which his title gave;<br>
A train, which well beseem&rsquo;d his state,<br>
But all unarm&rsquo;d, around him wait.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 150<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Still is thy name in high account,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And still thy verse has charms,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir David Lindesay of the Mount,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Lion King-at-arms!<br>
<br>
<br>
VIII.<br>
<br>
Down from his horse did Marmion spring,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 155<br>
Soon as he saw the Lion-King;<br>
For well the stately Baron knew<br>
To him such courtesy was due,<br>
Whom Royal James himself had crown&rsquo;d,<br>
And on his temples placed the round&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 160<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Scotland&rsquo;s ancient diadem:<br>
And wet his brow with hallow&rsquo;d wine,<br>
And on his finger given to shine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The emblematic gem.<br>
Their mutual greetings duly made,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 165<br>
The Lion thus his message said:-<br>
&lsquo;Though Scotland&rsquo;s King hath deeply swore<br>
Ne&rsquo;er to knit faith with Henry more,<br>
And strictly hath forbid resort<br>
From England to his royal court;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  170<br>
Yet, for he knows Lord Marmion&rsquo;s name,<br>
And honours much his warlike fame,<br>
My liege hath deem&rsquo;d it shame, and lack<br>
Of courtesy, to turn him back;<br>
And, by his order, I, your guide,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 175<br>
Must lodging fit and fair provide,<br>
Till finds King James meet time to see<br>
The flower of English chivalry.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
IX.<br>
<br>
Though inly chafed at this delay,<br>
Lord Marmion bears it as he may.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  180<br>
The Palmer, his mysterious guide,<br>
Beholding thus his place supplied,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sought to take leave in vain:<br>
Strict was the Lion-King&rsquo;s command,<br>
That none, who rode in Marmion&rsquo;s band,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  185<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Should sever from the train:<br>
&lsquo;England has here enow of spies<br>
In Lady Heron&rsquo;s witching eyes;&rsquo;<br>
To Marchmount thus, apart, he said,<br>
But fair pretext to Marmion made.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 190<br>
The right hand path they now decline,<br>
And trace against the stream the Tyne.<br>
<br>
<br>
X.<br>
<br>
At length up that wild dale they wind,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Crichtoun Castle crowns the bank;<br>
For there the Lion&rsquo;s care assign&rsquo;d&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  195<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A lodging meet for Marmion&rsquo;s rank.<br>
That Castle rises on the steep<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the green vale of Tyne:<br>
And far beneath, where slow they creep,<br>
From pool to eddy, dark and deep,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 200<br>
Where alders moist, and willows weep,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You hear her streams repine.<br>
The towers in different ages rose;<br>
Their various architecture shows<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The builders&rsquo; various hands;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 205<br>
A mighty mass, that could oppose,<br>
When deadliest hatred fired its foes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The vengeful Douglas bands.<br>
<br>
<br>
XI.<br>
<br>
Crichtoun! though now thy miry court<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But pens the lazy steer and sheep,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  210<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy turrets rude, and totter&rsquo;d Keep,<br>
Have been the minstrel&rsquo;s loved resort.<br>
Oft have I traced, within thy fort,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of mouldering shields the mystic sense,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Scutcheons of honour, or pretence,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  215<br>
Quarter&rsquo;d in old armorial sort,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Remains of rude magnificence.<br>
Nor wholly yet had time defaced<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy lordly gallery fair;<br>
Nor yet the stony cord unbraced,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  220<br>
Whose twisted knots, with roses laced,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Adorn thy ruin&rsquo;d stair.<br>
Still rises unimpair&rsquo;d below,<br>
The court-yard&rsquo;s graceful portico;<br>
Above its cornice, row and row&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  225<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of fair hewn facets richly show<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their pointed diamond form,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though there but houseless cattle go,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To shield them from the storm.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And, shuddering, still may we explore,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  230<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where oft whilom were captives pent,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkness of thy Massy More;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, from thy grass-grown battlement,<br>
May trace, in undulating line,<br>
The sluggish mazes of the Tyne.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 235<br>
<br>
<br>
XII.<br>
<br>
Another aspect Crichtoun show&rsquo;d,<br>
As through its portal Marmion rode;<br>
But yet &lsquo;twas melancholy state<br>
Received him at the outer gate;<br>
For none were in the Castle then,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 240<br>
But women, boys, or aged men.<br>
With eyes scarce dried, the sorrowing dame,<br>
To welcome noble Marmion, came;<br>
Her son, a stripling twelve years old,<br>
Proffer&rsquo;d the Baron&rsquo;s rein to hold;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 245<br>
For each man that could draw a sword<br>
Had march&rsquo;d that morning with their lord,<br>
Earl Adam Hepburn,-he who died<br>
On Flodden, by his sovereign&rsquo;s side.<br>
Long may his Lady look in vain!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 250<br>
She ne&rsquo;er shall see his gallant train,<br>
Come sweeping back through Crichtoun-Dean.<br>
&lsquo;Twas a brave race, before the name<br>
Of hated Bothwell stain&rsquo;d their fame.<br>
<br>
<br>
XIII.<br>
<br>
And here two days did Marmion rest,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 255<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With every rite that honour claims,<br>
Attended as the King&rsquo;s own guest;-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Such the command of Royal James,<br>
Who marshall&rsquo;d then his land&rsquo;s array,<br>
Upon the Borough-moor that lay.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 260<br>
Perchance he would not foeman&rsquo;s eye<br>
Upon his gathering host should pry,<br>
Till full prepared was every band<br>
To march against the English land.<br>
Here while they dwelt, did Lindesay&rsquo;s wit&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 265<br>
Oft cheer the Baron&rsquo;s moodier fit;<br>
And, in his turn, he knew to prize<br>
Lord Marmion&rsquo;s powerful mind, and wise,-<br>
Train&rsquo;d in the lore of Rome and Greece,<br>
And policies of war and peace.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  270<br>
<br>
<br>
XIV.<br>
<br>
It chanced, as fell the second night,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That on the battlements they walk&rsquo;d,<br>
And, by the slowly fading light,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of varying topics talk&rsquo;d;<br>
And, unaware, the Herald-bard&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 275<br>
Said, Marmion might his toil have spared,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In travelling so far;<br>
For that a messenger from heaven<br>
In vain to James had counsel given<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the English war:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;  280<br>
And, closer question&rsquo;d, thus he told<br>
A tale, which chronicles of old<br>
In Scottish story have enroll&rsquo;d:<br>
<br>
<br>
XV.<br>
<br>
Sir David Lindsey&rsquo;s Tale.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Of all the palaces so fair,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Built for the royal dwelling,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
285<br>
In Scotland, far beyond compare<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Linlithgow is excelling;<br>
And in its park, in jovial June,<br>
How sweet the merry linnet&rsquo;s tune,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;How blithe the blackbird&rsquo;s lay!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
290<br>
The wild buck bells from ferny brake,<br>
The coot dives merry on the lake,<br>
The saddest heart might pleasure take<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To see all nature gay.<br>
But June is to our Sovereign dear&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 295<br>
The heaviest month in all the year:<br>
Too well his cause of grief you know,<br>
June saw his father&rsquo;s overthrow.<br>
Woe to the traitors, who could bring<br>
The princely boy against his King!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  300<br>
Still in his conscience burns the sting.<br>
In offices as strict as Lent,<br>
King James&rsquo;s June is ever spent.<br>
<br>
<br>
XVI.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;When last this ruthful month was come,<br>
And in Linlithgow&rsquo;s holy dome&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
305<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The King, as wont, was praying;<br>
While, for his royal father&rsquo;s soul,<br>
The chanters sung, the bells did toll,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bishop mass was saying-<br>
For now the year brought round again&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  310<br>
The day the luckless King was slain-<br>
In Katharine&rsquo;s aisle the monarch knelt,<br>
With sackcloth-shirt, and iron belt,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And eyes with sorrow streaming;<br>
Around him in their stalls of state,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  315<br>
The Thistle&rsquo;s Knight-Companions sate,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their banners o&rsquo;er them beaming.<br>
I too was there, and, sooth to tell,<br>
Bedeafen&rsquo;d with the jangling knell,<br>
Was watching where the sunbeams fell,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 320<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the stain&rsquo;d casement gleaming;<br>
But, while I mark&rsquo;d what next befell,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It seem&rsquo;d as I were dreaming.<br>
Stepp&rsquo;d from the crowd a ghostly wight,<br>
In azure gown, with cincture white;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 325<br>
His forehead bald, his head was bare,<br>
Down hung at length his yellow hair.-<br>
Now, mock me not, when, good my Lord,<br>
I pledge to you my knightly word,<br>
That, when I saw his placid grace,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  330<br>
His simple majesty of face,<br>
His solemn bearing, and his pace<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So stately gliding on,-<br>
Seem&rsquo;d to me ne&rsquo;er did limner paint<br>
So just an image of the Saint,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  335<br>
Who propp&rsquo;d the Virgin in her faint,-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The loved Apostle John!<br>
<br>
<br>
XVII.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;He stepp&rsquo;d before the Monarch&rsquo;s chair,<br>
And stood with rustic plainness there,<br>
And little reverence made;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 340<br>
Nor head, nor body, bow&rsquo;d nor bent,<br>
But on the desk his arm he leant,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And words like these he said,<br>
In a low voice,-but never tone<br>
So thrill&rsquo;d through vein, and nerve, and bone:-<br>
&ldquo;My mother sent me from afar,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
346<br>
Sir King, to warn thee not to war,-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Woe waits on thine array;<br>
If war thou wilt, of woman fair,<br>
Her witching wiles and wanton snare,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  350<br>
James Stuart, doubly warn&rsquo;d, beware:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;God keep thee as He may!&rdquo;-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wondering monarch seem&rsquo;d to seek<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For answer, and found none;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when he raised his head to speak,&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 355<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monitor was gone.<br>
The Marshal and myself had cast<br>
To stop him as he outward pass&rsquo;d;<br>
But, lighter than the whirlwind&rsquo;s blast,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He vanish&rsquo;d from our eyes,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;  360<br>
Like sunbeam on the billow cast,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That glances but, and dies.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
XVIII.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;While Lindesay told his marvel strange,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twilight was so pale,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He mark&rsquo;d not Marmion&rsquo;s colour change,&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  365<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While listening to the tale:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But, after a suspended pause,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baron spoke:-&lsquo;Of Nature&rsquo;s laws<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So strong I held the force,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That never superhuman cause&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
370<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could e&rsquo;er control their course;<br>
And, three days since, had judged your aim<br>
Was but to make your guest your game.<br>
But I have seen, since past the Tweed,<br>
What much has changed my sceptic creed,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 375<br>
And made me credit aught.&rsquo;-He staid,<br>
And seem&rsquo;d to wish his words unsaid:<br>
But, by that strong emotion press&rsquo;d,<br>
Which prompts us to unload our breast,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Even when discovery&rsquo;s pain,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; 380<br>
To Lindesay did at length unfold<br>
The tale his village host had told,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At Gifford, to his train.<br>
Nought of the Palmer says he there,<br>
And nought of Constance, or of Clare;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 385<br>
The thoughts, which broke his sleep, he seems<br>
To mention but as feverish dreams.<br>
<br>
<br>
XIX.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;In vain,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;to rest I spread<br>
My burning limbs, and couch&rsquo;d my head:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fantastic thoughts return&rsquo;d;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 390<br>
And, by their wild dominion led,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart within me burn&rsquo;d.<br>
So sore was the delirious goad,<br>
I took my steed, and forth I rode,<br>
And, as the moon shone bright and cold,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 395<br>
Soon reach&rsquo;d the camp upon the wold.<br>
The southern entrance I pass&rsquo;d through,<br>
And halted, and my bugle blew.<br>
Methought an answer met my ear,-<br>
Yet was the blast so low and drear,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 400<br>
So hollow, and so faintly blown,<br>
It might be echo of my own.<br>
<br>
<br>
XX.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Thus judging, for a little space<br>
I listen&rsquo;d, ere I left the place;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But scarce could trust my eyes,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 405<br>
Nor yet can think they serve me true,<br>
When sudden in the ring I view,<br>
In form distinct of shape and hue,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A mounted champion rise.-<br>
I&rsquo;ve fought, Lord-Lion, many a day,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 410<br>
In single fight, and mix&rsquo;d affray,<br>
And ever, I myself may say,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Have borne me as a knight;<br>
But when this unexpected foe<br>
Seem&rsquo;d starting from the gulf below,-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  415<br>
I care not though the truth I show,-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I trembled with affright;<br>
And as I placed in rest my spear,<br>
My hand so shook for very fear,<br>
I scarce could couch it right.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  420<br>
<br>
<br>
XXI.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Why need my tongue the issue tell?<br>
We ran our course,-my charger fell;-<br>
What could he &lsquo;gainst the shock of hell?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I roll&rsquo;d upon the plain.<br>
High o&rsquo;er my head, with threatening hand,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 425<br>
The spectre shook his naked brand,-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet did the worst remain:<br>
My dazzled eyes I upward cast,-<br>
Not opening hell itself could blast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their sight, like what I saw!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
430<br>
Full on his face the moonbeam strook!-<br>
A face could never be mistook!<br>
I knew the stern vindictive look,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And held my breath for awe.<br>
I saw the face of one who, fled&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 435<br>
To foreign climes, has long been dead,-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I well believe the last;<br>
For ne&rsquo;er, from vizor raised, did stare<br>
A human warrior, with a glare<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So grimly and so ghast.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; 440<br>
Thrice o&rsquo;er my head he shook the blade;<br>
But when to good Saint George I pray&rsquo;d,<br>
(The first time e&rsquo;er I ask&rsquo;d his aid),<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He plunged it in the sheath;<br>
And, on his courser mounting light,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 445<br>
He seem&rsquo;d to vanish from my sight:<br>
The moonbeam droop&rsquo;d, and deepest night<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunk down upon the heath.-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Twere long to tell what cause I have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To know his face, that met me there,&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  450<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call&rsquo;d by his hatred from the grave,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cumber upper air:<br>
Dead, or alive, good cause had he<br>
To be my mortal enemy.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
XXII.<br>
<br>
Marvell&rsquo;d Sir David of the Mount;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 455<br>
Then, learn&rsquo;d in story, &lsquo;gan recount<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Such chance had happ&rsquo;d of old,<br>
When once, near Norham, there did fight<br>
A spectre fell of fiendish might,<br>
In likeness of a Scottish knight,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 460<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With Brian Bulmer bold,<br>
And train&rsquo;d him nigh to disallow<br>
The aid of his baptismal vow.<br>
&lsquo;And such a phantom, too, &lsquo;tis said,<br>
With Highland broadsword, targe, and plaid&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  465<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And fingers red with gore,<br>
Is seen in Rothiemurcus glade,<br>
Or where the sable pine-tree shade<br>
Dark Tomantoul, and Auchnaslaid,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dromouchty, or Glenmore.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;  470<br>
And yet, whate&rsquo;er such legends say,<br>
Of warlike demon, ghost, or lay,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On mountain, moor, or plain,<br>
Spotless in faith, in bosom bold,<br>
True son of chivalry should hold&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  475<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;These midnight terrors vain;<br>
For seldom have such spirits power<br>
To harm, save in the evil hour,<br>
When guilt we meditate within,<br>
Or harbour unrepented sin.&rsquo;-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
480<br>
Lord Marmion turn&rsquo;d him half aside,<br>
And twice to clear his voice he tried,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then press&rsquo;d Sir David&rsquo;s hand,-<br>
But nought, at length, in answer said;<br>
And here their farther converse staid,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  485<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Each ordering that his band<br>
Should bowne them with the rising day,<br>
To Scotland&rsquo;s camp to take their way,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Such was the King&rsquo;s command.<br>
<br>
<br>
XXIII.<br>
<br>
Early they took Dun-Edin&rsquo;s road,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  490<br>
And I could trace each step they trode:<br>
Hill, brook, nor dell, nor rock, nor stone,<br>
Lies on the path to me unknown.<br>
Much might if boast of storied lore;<br>
But, passing such digression o&rsquo;er,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  495<br>
Suffice it that their route was laid<br>
Across the furzy hills of Braid.<br>
They pass&rsquo;d the glen and scanty rill,<br>
And climb&rsquo;d the opposing bank, until<br>
They gain&rsquo;d the top of Blackford Hill.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  500<br>
<br>
<br>
XXIV.<br>
<br>
Blackford! on whose uncultured breast,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the broom, and thorn, and whin,<br>
A truant-boy, I sought the nest,<br>
Or listed, as I lay at rest,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;While rose, on breezes thin,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 505<br>
The murmur of the city crowd,<br>
And, from his steeple jangling loud,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Giles&rsquo;s mingling din.<br>
Now, from the summit to the plain,<br>
Waves all the hill with yellow grain;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 510<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And o&rsquo;er the landscape as I look,<br>
Nought do I see unchanged remain,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Save the rude cliffs and chiming brook.<br>
To me they make a heavy moan,<br>
Of early friendships past and gone.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 515<br>
<br>
<br>
XXV.<br>
<br>
But different far the change has been,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Marmion, from the crown<br>
Of Blackford, saw that martial scene<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the bent so brown:<br>
Thousand pavilions, white as snow,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  520<br>
Spread all the Borough-moor below,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upland, and dale, and down:-<br>
A thousand did I say? I ween,<br>
Thousands on thousands there were seen<br>
That chequer&rsquo;d all the heath between&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  525<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The streamlet and the town;<br>
In crossing ranks extending far,<br>
Forming a camp irregular;<br>
Oft giving way, where still there stood<br>
Some relics of the old oak wood,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  530<br>
That darkly huge did intervene,<br>
And tamed the glaring white with green:<br>
In these extended lines there lay<br>
A martial kingdom&rsquo;s vast array.<br>
<br>
<br>
XXVI.<br>
<br>
For from Hebudes, dark with rain,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 535<br>
To eastern Lodon&rsquo;s fertile plain,<br>
And from the southern Redswire edge,<br>
To farthest Rosse&rsquo;s rocky ledge:<br>
From west to east, from south to north,<br>
Scotland sent all her warriors forth.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 540<br>
Marmion might hear the mingled hum<br>
Of myriads up the mountain come;<br>
The horses&rsquo; tramp, and tingling clank,<br>
Where chiefs review&rsquo;d their vassal rank,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And charger&rsquo;s shrilling neigh;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 545<br>
And see the shifting lines advance,<br>
While frequent flash&rsquo;d, from shield and lance,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun&rsquo;s reflected ray.<br>
<br>
<br>
XXVII.<br>
<br>
Thin curling in the morning air,<br>
The wreaths of failing smoke declare&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  550<br>
To embers now the brands decay&rsquo;d,<br>
Where the night-watch their fires had made.<br>
They saw, slow rolling on the plain,<br>
Full many a baggage-cart and wain,<br>
And dire artillery&rsquo;s clumsy car,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  555<br>
By sluggish oxen tugg&rsquo;d to war;<br>
And there were Borthwick&rsquo;s Sisters Seven,<br>
And culverins which France had given.<br>
Ill-omen&rsquo;d gift! the guns remain<br>
The conqueror&rsquo;s spoil on Flodden plain.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 560<br>
<br>
<br>
XXVIII.<br>
<br>
Nor mark&rsquo;d they less, where in the air<br>
A thousand streamers flaunted fair;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Various in shape, device, and hue,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Green, sanguine, purple, red, and blue,<br>
Broad, narrow, swallow-tail&rsquo;d, and square,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  565<br>
Scroll, pennon, pensil, bandrol, there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O&rsquo;er the pavilions flew.<br>
Highest, and midmost, was descried<br>
The royal banner floating wide;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The staff, a pine-tree, strong and straight,&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  570<br>
Pitch&rsquo;d deeply in a massive stone,<br>
Which still in memory is shown,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet bent beneath the standard&rsquo;s weight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whene&rsquo;er the western wind unroll&rsquo;d,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With toil, the huge and cumbrous fold,&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  575<br>
And gave to view the dazzling field,<br>
Where, in proud Scotland&rsquo;s royal shield,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ruddy lion ramp&rsquo;d in gold.<br>
<br>
<br>
XXIX.<br>
<br>
Lord Marmion view&rsquo;d the landscape bright,-<br>
He view&rsquo;d it with a chiefs delight,-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 580<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Until within him burn&rsquo;d his heart,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And lightning from his eye did part,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As on the battle-day;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Such glance did falcon never dart,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When stooping on his prey.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;  585<br>
&lsquo;Oh! well, Lord-Lion, hast thou said,<br>
Thy King from warfare to dissuade<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were but a vain essay:<br>
For, by St. George, were that host mine,<br>
Not power infernal, nor divine,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 590<br>
Should once to peace my soul incline,<br>
Till I had dimm&rsquo;d their armour&rsquo;s shine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In glorious battle-fray!&rsquo;<br>
Answer&rsquo;d the Bard, of milder mood:<br>
&lsquo;Fair is the sight,-and yet &lsquo;twere good,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 595<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That Kings would think withal,<br>
When peace and wealth their land has bless&rsquo;d,<br>
&lsquo;Tis better to sit still at rest,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than rise, perchance to fall.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
XXX.<br>
<br>
Still on the spot Lord Marmion stay&rsquo;d,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  600<br>
For fairer scene he ne&rsquo;er survey&rsquo;d.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When sated with the martial show<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That peopled all the plain below,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The wandering eye could o&rsquo;er it go,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And mark the distant city glow&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  605<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With gloomy splendour red;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For on the smoke-wreaths, huge and slow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That round her sable turrets flow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning beams were shed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And tinged them with a lustre proud,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  610<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like that which streaks a thunder-cloud.<br>
Such dusky grandeur clothed the height,<br>
Where the huge Castle holds its state,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the steep slope down,<br>
Whose ridgy back heaves to the sky,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 615<br>
Piled deep and massy, close and high,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mine own romantic town!<br>
But northward far, with purer blaze,<br>
On Ochil mountains fell the rays,<br>
And as each heathy top they kiss&rsquo;d,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 620<br>
It gleam&rsquo;d a purple amethyst.<br>
Yonder the shores of Fife you saw;<br>
Here Preston-Bay, and Berwick-Law;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And, broad between them roll&rsquo;d,<br>
The gallant Frith the eye might note,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 625<br>
Whose islands on its bosom float,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like emeralds chased in gold.<br>
Fitz-Eustace&rsquo; heart felt closely pent;<br>
As if to give his rapture vent,<br>
The spur he to his charger lent,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  630<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And raised his bridle hand,<br>
And, making demi-volte in air,<br>
Cried, &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s the coward that would not dare<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To fight for such a land!&rsquo;<br>
The Lindesay smiled his joy to see;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 635<br>
Nor Marmion&rsquo;s frown repress&rsquo;d his glee.<br>
<br>
<br>
XXXI.<br>
<br>
Thus while they look&rsquo;d, a flourish proud,<br>
Where mingled trump, and clarion loud,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And fife, and kettle-drum,<br>
And sackbut deep, and psaltery,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 640<br>
And war-pipe with discordant cry,<br>
And cymbal clattering to the sky,<br>
Making wild music bold and high,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Did up the mountain come;<br>
The whilst the bells, with distant chime,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 645<br>
Merrily toll&rsquo;d the hour of prime,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus the Lindesay spoke:<br>
&lsquo;Thus clamour still the war-notes when<br>
The King to mass his way has ta&rsquo;en,<br>
Or to Saint Katharine&rsquo;s of Sienne,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  650<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or Chapel of Saint Rocque.<br>
To you they speak of martial fame;<br>
But me remind of peaceful game,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When blither was their cheer,<br>
Thrilling in Falkland-woods the air,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  655<br>
In signal none his steed should spare,<br>
But strive which foremost might repair<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To the downfall of the deer.<br>
<br>
<br>
XXXII.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Nor less,&rsquo; he said,-&lsquo;when looking forth,<br>
I view yon Empress of the North&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 660<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sit on her hilly throne;<br>
Her palace&rsquo;s imperial bowers,<br>
Her castle, proof to hostile powers,<br>
Her stately halls and holy towers-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor less,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I moan,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;  665<br>
To think what woe mischance may bring,<br>
And how these merry bells may ring<br>
The death-dirge of our gallant King;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or with the larum call<br>
The burghers forth to watch and ward,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 670<br>
&lsquo;Gainst southern sack and fires to guard<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dun-Edin&rsquo;s leaguer&rsquo;d wall.-<br>
But not for my presaging thought,<br>
Dream conquest sure, or cheaply bought!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Marmion, I say nay:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;  675<br>
God is the guider of the field,<br>
He breaks the champion&rsquo;s spear and shield,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But thou thyself shalt say,<br>
When joins yon host in deadly stowre,<br>
That England&rsquo;s dames must weep in bower,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  680<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her monks the death-mass sing;<br>
For never saw&rsquo;st thou such a power<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Led on by such a King.&rsquo;-<br>
And now, down winding to the plain,<br>
The barriers of the camp they gain,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 685<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And there they made a stay.-<br>
There stays the Minstrel, till he fling<br>
His hand o&rsquo;er every Border string,<br>
And fit his harp the pomp to sing,<br>
Of Scotland&rsquo;s ancient Court and King,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 695<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the succeeding lay.<br>

<b>INTRODUCTION TO CANTO FIFTH</b>.<br>

<i>TO GEORGE ELLIS, ESQ.<br>
<br>
Edinburgh</i>.<br>
<br>
When dark December glooms the day,<br>
And takes our autumn joys away;<br>
When short and scant the sunbeam throws,<br>
Upon the weary waste of snows,<br>
A cold and profitless regard,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
5<br>
Like patron on a needy bard;<br>
When silvan occupation&rsquo;s done,<br>
And o&rsquo;er the chimney rests the gun,<br>
And hang, in idle trophy, near,<br>
The game-pouch, fishing-rod, and spear;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  10<br>
When wiry terrier, rough and grim,<br>
And greyhound, with his length of limb,<br>
And pointer, now employ&rsquo;d no more,<br>
Cumber our parlour&rsquo;s narrow floor;<br>
When in his stall the impatient steed&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  15<br>
Is long condemn&rsquo;d to rest and feed;<br>
When from our snow-encircled home,<br>
Scarce cares the hardiest step to roam<br>
Since path is none, save that to bring<br>
The needful water from the spring;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 20<br>
When wrinkled news-page, thrice conn&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er,<br>
Beguiles the dreary hour no more,<br>
And darkling politician, cross&rsquo;d,<br>
Inveighs against the lingering post,<br>
And answering housewife sore complains&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 25<br>
Of carriers&rsquo; snow-impeded wains;<br>
When such the country cheer, I come,<br>
Well pleased, to seek our city home;<br>
For converse, and for books, to change<br>
The Forest&rsquo;s melancholy range,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
30<br>
And welcome, with renew&rsquo;d delight,<br>
The busy day and social night.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not here need my desponding rhyme<br>
Lament the ravages of time,<br>
As erst by Newark&rsquo;s riven towers,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  35<br>
And Ettrick stripp&rsquo;d of forest bowers.<br>
True,-Caledonia&rsquo;s Queen is changed,<br>
Since on her dusky summit ranged,<br>
Within its steepy limits pent,<br>
By bulwark, line, and battlement,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  40<br>
And flanking towers, and laky flood,<br>
Guarded and garrison&rsquo;d she stood,<br>
Denying entrance or resort,<br>
Save at each tall embattled port;<br>
Above whose arch, suspended, hung&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  45<br>
Portcullis spiked with iron prong.<br>
That long is gone,-but not so long,<br>
Since, early closed, and opening late,<br>
Jealous revolved the studded gate,<br>
Whose task, from eve to morning tide,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  50<br>
A wicket churlishly supplied.<br>
Stern then, and steel-girt was thy brow,<br>
Dun-Edin! O, how altered now,<br>
When safe amid thy mountain court<br>
Thou sitt&rsquo;st, like Empress at her sport,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 55<br>
And liberal, unconfined, and free,<br>
Flinging thy white arms to the sea,<br>
For thy dark cloud, with umber&rsquo;d lower,<br>
That hung o&rsquo;er cliff, and lake, and tower,<br>
Thou gleam&rsquo;st against the western ray&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  60<br>
Ten thousand lines of brighter day.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not she, the Championess of old,<br>
In Spenser&rsquo;s magic tale enroll&rsquo;d,<br>
She for the charmed spear renown&rsquo;d,<br>
Which forced each knight to kiss the ground,-<br>
Not she more changed, when, placed at rest,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  66<br>
What time she was Malbecco&rsquo;s guest,<br>
She gave to flow her maiden vest;<br>
When from the corselet&rsquo;s grasp relieved,<br>
Free to the sight her bosom heaved;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  70<br>
Sweet was her blue eye&rsquo;s modest smile,<br>
Erst hidden by the aventayle;<br>
And down her shoulders graceful roll&rsquo;d<br>
Her locks profuse, of paly gold.<br>
They who whilom, in midnight fight,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  75<br>
Had marvell&rsquo;d at her matchless might,<br>
No less her maiden charms approved,<br>
But looking liked, and liking loved.<br>
The sight could jealous pangs beguile,<br>
And charm Malbecco&rsquo;s cares a while;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  80<br>
And he, the wandering Squire of Dames,<br>
Forgot his Columbella&rsquo;s claims,<br>
And passion, erst unknown, could gain<br>
The breast of blunt Sir Satyrane;<br>
Nor durst light Paridel advance,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 85<br>
Bold as he was, a looser glance.<br>
She charm&rsquo;d, at once, and tamed the heart,<br>
Incomparable Britomane!<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So thou, fair City! disarray&rsquo;d<br>
Of battled wall, and rampart&rsquo;s aid,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  90<br>
As stately seem&rsquo;st, but lovelier far<br>
Than in that panoply of war.<br>
Nor deem that from thy fenceless throne<br>
Strength and security are flown;<br>
Still as of yore, Queen of the North!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  95<br>
Still canst thou send thy children forth.<br>
Ne&rsquo;er readier at alarm-bell&rsquo;s call<br>
Thy burghers rose to man thy wall,<br>
Than now, in danger, shall be thine,<br>
Thy dauntless voluntary line;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 100<br>
For fosse and turret proud to stand,<br>
Their breasts the bulwarks of the land.<br>
Thy thousands, train&rsquo;d to martial toil,<br>
Full red would stain their native soil,<br>
Ere from thy mural crown there fell&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 105<br>
The slightest knosp, or pinnacle.<br>
And if it come,-as come it may,<br>
Dun-Edin! that eventful day,-<br>
Renown&rsquo;d for hospitable deed,<br>
That virtue much with Heaven may plead,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 110<br>
In patriarchal times whose care<br>
Descending angels deign&rsquo;d to share;<br>
That claim may wrestle blessings down<br>
On those who fight for The Good Town,<br>
Destined in every age to be&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
115<br>
Refuge of injured royalty;<br>
Since first, when conquering York arose,<br>
To Henry meek she gave repose,<br>
Till late, with wonder, grief, and awe,<br>
Great Bourbon&rsquo;s relics, sad she saw.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  120<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Truce to these thoughts!-for, as they rise,<br>
How gladly I avert mine eyes,<br>
Bodings, or true or false, to change,<br>
For Fiction&rsquo;s fair romantic range,<br>
Or for Tradition&rsquo;s dubious light,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 125<br>
That hovers &lsquo;twixt the day and night:<br>
Dazzling alternately and dim<br>
Her wavering lamp I&rsquo;d rather trim,<br>
Knights, squires, and lovely dames, to see,<br>
Creation of my fantasy,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; 130<br>
Than gaze abroad on reeky fen,<br>
And make of mists invading men.-<br>
Who loves not more the night of June<br>
Than dull December&rsquo;s gloomy noon?<br>
The moonlight than the fog of frost?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  135<br>
But can we say, which cheats the most?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But who shall teach my harp to gain<br>
A sound of the romantic strain,<br>
Whose Anglo-Norman tones whilere<br>
Could win the royal Henry&rsquo;s ear,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  140<br>
Famed Beauclerk call&rsquo;d, for that he loved<br>
The minstrel, and his lay approved?<br>
Who shall these lingering notes redeem,<br>
Decaying on Oblivion&rsquo;s stream;<br>
Such notes as from the Breton tongue&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  145<br>
Marie translated, Blondel sung?-<br>
O! born, Time&rsquo;s ravage to repair,<br>
And make the dying Muse thy care;<br>
Who, when his scythe her hoary foe<br>
Was poising for the final blow,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 150<br>
The weapon from his hand could wring,<br>
And break his glass, and shear his wing,<br>
And bid, reviving in his strain,<br>
The gentle poet live again;<br>
Thou, who canst give to lightest lay&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  155<br>
An unpedantic moral gay,<br>
Nor less the dullest theme bid flit<br>
On wings of unexpected wit;<br>
In letters as in life approved,<br>
Example honour&rsquo;d, and beloved,-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  160<br>
Dear ELLIS! to the bard impart<br>
A lesson of thy magic art,<br>
To win at once the head and heart,-<br>
At once to charm, instruct, and mend,<br>
My guide, my pattern, and my friend!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  165<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Such minstrel lesson to bestow<br>
Be long thy pleasing task,-but, O!<br>
No more by thy example teach,-<br>
What few can practise, all can preach,-<br>
With even patience to endure&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  170<br>
Lingering disease, and painful cure,<br>
And boast affliction&rsquo;s pangs subdued<br>
By mild and manly fortitude.<br>
Enough, the lesson has been given:<br>
Forbid the repetition, Heaven!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  175<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Come listen, then! for thou hast known,<br>
And loved the Minstrel&rsquo;s varying tone,<br>
Who, like his Border sires of old,<br>
Waked a wild measure rude and bold,<br>
Till Windsor&rsquo;s oaks, and Ascot plain,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 180<br>
With wonder heard the northern strain.<br>
Come listen! bold in thy applause,<br>
The Bard shall scorn pedantic laws;<br>
And, as the ancient art could stain<br>
Achievements on the storied pane,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 185<br>
Irregularly traced and plann&rsquo;d,<br>
But yet so glowing and so grand,-<br>
So shall he strive, in changeful hue,<br>
Field, feast, and combat, to renew,<br>
And loves, and arms, and harpers&rsquo; glee,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 191<br>
And all the pomp of chivalry.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>CANTO FIFTH</b>.<br>
<br>
THE COURT.<br>
<br>
<br>
I.<br>
<br>
The train has left the hills of Braid;<br>
The barrier guard have open made<br>
(So Lindesay bade) the palisade,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That closed the tented ground;<br>
Their men the warders backward drew,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  5<br>
And carried pikes as they rode through,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Into its ample bound.<br>
Fast ran the Scottish warriors there,<br>
Upon the Southern band to stare.<br>
And envy with their wonder rose,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 10<br>
To see such well-appointed foes;<br>
Such length of shafts, such mighty bows,<br>
So huge, that many simply thought,<br>
But for a vaunt such weapons wrought;<br>
And little deem&rsquo;d their force to feel,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 15<br>
Through links of mail, and plates of steel,<br>
When rattling upon Flodden vale,<br>
The cloth-yard arrows flew like hail.<br>
<br>
<br>
II.<br>
<br>
Nor less did Marmion&rsquo;s skilful view<br>
Glance every line and squadron through;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  20<br>
And much he marvell&rsquo;d one small land<br>
Could marshal forth such various band;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For men-at-arms were here,<br>
Heavily sheathed in mail and plate,<br>
Like iron towers for strength and weight,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  25<br>
On Flemish steeds of bone and height,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With battle-axe and spear.<br>
Young knights and squires, a lighter train,<br>
Practised their chargers on the plain,<br>
By aid of leg, of hand, and rein,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  30<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Each warlike feat to show,<br>
To pass, to wheel, the croupe to gain,<br>
And high curvett, that not in vain<br>
The sword sway might descend amain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On foeman&rsquo;s casque below.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  35<br>
He saw the hardy burghers there<br>
March arm&rsquo;d, on foot, with faces bare,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For vizor they wore none,<br>
Nor waving plume, nor crest of knight;<br>
But burnish&rsquo;d were their corslets bright,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  40<br>
Their brigantines, and gorgets light,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like very silver shone.<br>
Long pikes they had for standing fight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Two-handed swords they wore,<br>
And many wielded mace of weight,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 45<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And bucklers bright they bore.<br>
<br>
<br>
III.<br>
<br>
On foot the yeoman too, but dress&rsquo;d<br>
In his steel-jack, a swarthy vest,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With iron quilted well;<br>
Each at his back (a slender store)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 50<br>
His forty days&rsquo; provision bore,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As feudal statutes tell.<br>
His arms were halbert, axe, or spear,<br>
A crossbow there, a hagbut here,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A dagger-knife, and brand.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; 55<br>
Sober he seem&rsquo;d, and sad of cheer,<br>
As loath to leave his cottage dear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And march to foreign strand;<br>
Or musing, who would guide his steer,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To till the fallow land.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; 60<br>
Yet deem not in his thoughtful eye<br>
Did aught of dastard terror lie;<br>
More dreadful far his ire,<br>
Than theirs, who, scorning danger&rsquo;s name,<br>
In eager mood to battle came,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  65<br>
Their valour like light straw on name,<br>
A fierce but fading fire.<br>
<br>
<br>
IV.<br>
<br>
Not so the Borderer:-bred to war,<br>
He knew the battle&rsquo;s din afar,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And joy&rsquo;d to hear it swell.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;  70<br>
His peaceful day was slothful ease;<br>
Nor harp, nor pipe, his ear could please,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the loud slogan yell.<br>
On active steed, with lance and blade,<br>
The light-arm&rsquo;d pricker plied his trade,-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 75<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Let nobles fight for fame;<br>
Let vassals follow where they lead,<br>
Burghers, to guard their townships, bleed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But war&rsquo;s the Borderer&rsquo;s game.<br>
Their gain, their glory, their delight,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  80<br>
To sleep the day, maraud the night,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O&rsquo;er mountain, moss, and moor;<br>
Joyful to fight they took their way,<br>
Scarce caring who might win the day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their booty was secure.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  85<br>
These, as Lord Marmion&rsquo;s train pass&rsquo;d by,<br>
Look&rsquo;d on at first with careless eye,<br>
Nor marvell&rsquo;d aught, well taught to know<br>
The form and force of English bow.<br>
But when they saw the Lord array&rsquo;d&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 90<br>
In splendid arms, and rich brocade,<br>
Each Borderer to his kinsman said,-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Hist, Ringan! seest thou there!<br>
Canst guess which road they&rsquo;ll homeward ride?-<br>
O! could we but on Border side,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  95<br>
By Eusedale glen, or Liddell&rsquo;s tide,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Beset a prize so fair!<br>
That fangless Lion, too, their guide,<br>
Might chance to lose his glistering hide;<br>
Brown Maudlin, of that doublet pied,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  100<br>
Could make a kirtle rare.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
V.<br>
<br>
Next, Marmion marked the Celtic race,<br>
Of different language, form, and face,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A various race of man;<br>
Just then the Chiefs their tribes array&rsquo;d,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  105<br>
And wild and garish semblance made,<br>
The chequer&rsquo;d trews, and belted plaid,<br>
And varying notes the war-pipes bray&rsquo;d,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To every varying clan,<br>
Wild through their red or sable hair&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  110<br>
Look&rsquo;d out their eyes with savage stare,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On Marmion as he pass&rsquo;d;<br>
Their legs above the knee were bare;<br>
Their frame was sinewy, short, and spare,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And harden&rsquo;d to the blast;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;  115<br>
Of taller race, the chiefs they own<br>
Were by the eagle&rsquo;s plumage known.<br>
The hunted red-deer&rsquo;s undress&rsquo;d hide<br>
Their hairy buskins well supplied;<br>
The graceful bonnet deck&rsquo;d their head:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  120<br>
Back from their shoulders hung the plaid;<br>
A broadsword of unwieldy length,<br>
A dagger proved for edge and strength,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A studded targe they wore,<br>
And quivers, bows, and shafts,-but, O!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 125<br>
Short was the shaft, and weak the bow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To that which England bore.<br>
The Isles-men carried at their backs<br>
The ancient Danish battle-axe.<br>
They raised a wild and wondering cry,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 130<br>
As with his guide rode Marmion by.<br>
Loud were their clamouring tongues, as when<br>
The clanging sea-fowl leave the fen,<br>
And, with their cries discordant mix&rsquo;d,<br>
Grumbled and yell&rsquo;d the pipes betwixt.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  135<br>
<br>
<br>
VI.<br>
<br>
Thus through the Scottish camp they pass&rsquo;d,<br>
And reach&rsquo;d the City gate at last,<br>
Where all around, a wakeful guard,<br>
Arm&rsquo;d burghers kept their watch and ward.<br>
Well had they cause of jealous fear,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  140<br>
When lay encamp&rsquo;d, in field so near,<br>
The Borderer and the Mountaineer.<br>
As through the bustling streets they go,<br>
All was alive with martial show:<br>
At every turn, with dinning clang,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  145<br>
The armourer&rsquo;s anvil clash&rsquo;d and rang;<br>
Or toil&rsquo;d the swarthy smith, to wheel<br>
The bar that arms the charger&rsquo;s heel;<br>
Or axe, or falchion, to the side<br>
Of jarring grindstone was applied.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  150<br>
Page, groom, and squire, with hurrying pace<br>
Through street, and lane, and market-place,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bore lance, or casque, or sword;<br>
While burghers, with important face,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Described each new-come lord,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
155<br>
Discuss&rsquo;d his lineage, told his name,<br>
His following, and his warlike fame.<br>
The Lion led to lodging meet,<br>
Which high o&rsquo;erlook&rsquo;d the crowded street;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There must the Baron rest,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 160<br>
Till past the hour of vesper tide,<br>
And then to Holy-Rood must ride,-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Such was the King&rsquo;s behest.<br>
Meanwhile the Lion&rsquo;s care assigns<br>
A banquet rich, and costly wines,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 165<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To Marmion and his train;<br>
And when the appointed hour succeeds,<br>
The Baron dons his peaceful weeds,<br>
And following Lindesay as he leads,<br>
The palace-halls they gain.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
170<br>
<br>
<br>
VIL<br>
<br>
Old Holy-Rood rung merrily,<br>
That night, with wassell, mirth, and glee:<br>
King James within her princely bower<br>
Feasted the Chiefs of Scotland&rsquo;s power,<br>
Summon&rsquo;d to spend the parting hour;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 175<br>
For he had charged, that his array<br>
Should southward march by break of day.<br>
Well loved that splendid monarch aye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The banquet and the song,<br>
By day the tourney, and by night&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  180<br>
The merry dance, traced fast and light,<br>
The maskers quaint, the pageant bright,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The revel loud and long.<br>
This feast outshone his banquets past;<br>
It was his blithest,-and his last.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 185<br>
The dazzling lamps, from gallery gay,<br>
Cast on the Court a dancing ray;<br>
Here to the harp did minstrels sing;<br>
There ladies touched a softer string;<br>
With long-ear&rsquo;d cap, and motley vest,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 190<br>
The licensed fool retail&rsquo;d his jest;<br>
His magic tricks the juggler plied;<br>
At dice and draughts the gallants vied;<br>
While some, in close recess apart,<br>
Courted the ladies of their heart,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  195<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor courted them in vain;<br>
For often, in the parting hour,<br>
Victorious Love asserts his power<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O&rsquo;er coldness and disdain;<br>
And flinty is her heart, can view&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 200<br>
To battle march a lover true-<br>
Can hear, perchance, his last adieu,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor own her share of pain.<br>
<br>
<br>
VIII.<br>
<br>
Through this mix&rsquo;d crowd of glee and game,<br>
The King to greet Lord Marmion came,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  205<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;While, reverent, all made room.<br>
An easy task it was, I trow,<br>
King James&rsquo;s manly form to know,<br>
Although, his courtesy to show,<br>
He doff&rsquo;d, to Marmion bending low,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  210<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His broider&rsquo;d cap and plume.<br>
For royal was his garb and mien,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His cloak, of crimson velvet piled,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Trimm&rsquo;d with the fur of marten wild;<br>
His vest of changeful satin sheen,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  215<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The dazzled eye beguiled;<br>
His gorgeous collar hung adown,<br>
Wrought with the badge of Scotland&rsquo;s crown,<br>
The thistle brave, of old renown:<br>
His trusty blade, Toledo right,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 220<br>
Descended from a baldric bright;<br>
White were his buskins, on the heel<br>
His spurs inlaid of gold and steel;<br>
His bonnet, all of crimson fair,<br>
Was button&rsquo;d with a ruby rare:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  225<br>
And Marmion deem&rsquo;d he ne&rsquo;er had seen<br>
A prince of such a noble mien.<br>
<br>
<br>
IX.<br>
<br>
The Monarch&rsquo;s form was middle size;<br>
For feat of strength, or exercise,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shaped in proportion fair;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 230<br>
And hazel was his eagle eye,<br>
And auburn of the darkest dye,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His short curl&rsquo;d beard and hair.<br>
Light was his footstep in the dance,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And firm his stirrup in the lists;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  235<br>
And, oh! he had that merry glance,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That seldom lady&rsquo;s heart resists.<br>
Lightly from fair to fair he flew,<br>
And loved to plead, lament, and sue;-<br>
Suit lightly won, and short-lived pain,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 240<br>
For monarchs seldom sigh in vain.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I said he joy&rsquo;d in banquet bower;<br>
But, &lsquo;mid his mirth, &lsquo;twas often strange,<br>
How suddenly his cheer would change,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His look o&rsquo;ercast and lower,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 245<br>
If, in a sudden turn, he felt<br>
The pressure of his iron belt,<br>
That bound his breast in penance pain,<br>
In memory of his father slain.<br>
Even so &lsquo;twas strange how, evermore,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  250<br>
Soon as the passing pang was o&rsquo;er,<br>
Forward he rush&rsquo;d, with double glee,<br>
Into the stream of revelry:<br>
Thus, dim-seen object of affright<br>
Startles the courser in his flight,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 255<br>
And half he halts, half springs aside;<br>
But feels the quickening spur applied,<br>
And, straining on the tighten&rsquo;d rein,<br>
Scours doubly swift o&rsquo;er hill and plain.<br>
<br>
<br>
X.<br>
<br>
O&rsquo;er James&rsquo;s heart, the courtiers say,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  260<br>
Sir Hugh the Heron&rsquo;s wife held sway:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To Scotland&rsquo;s Court she came,<br>
To be a hostage for her lord,<br>
Who Cessford&rsquo;s gallant heart had gored,<br>
And with the King to make accord,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 265<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Had sent his lovely dame.<br>
Nor to that lady free alone<br>
Did the gay King allegiance own;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For the fair Queen of France<br>
Sent him a turquois ring and glove,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 270<br>
And charged him, as her knight and love,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For her to break a lance;<br>
And strike three strokes with Scottish brand,<br>
And march three miles on Southron land,<br>
And bid the banners of his band&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 275<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In English breezes dance.<br>
And thus, for France&rsquo;s Queen he drest<br>
His manly limbs in mailed vest;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus admitted English fair<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His inmost counsels still to share;&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 280<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus, for both, he madly plann&rsquo;d<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ruin of himself and land!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet, the sooth to tell,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor England&rsquo;s fair, nor France&rsquo;s
Queen,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were worth one pearl-drop, bright and sheen,&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  285<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Margaret&rsquo;s eyes that
fell,-<br>
His own Queen Margaret, who, in Lithgow&rsquo;s bower,<br>
All lonely sat, and wept the weary hour.<br>
<br>
<br>
XI.<br>
<br>
The Queen sits lone in Lithgow pile,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And weeps the weary day,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;  290<br>
The war against her native soil,<br>
Her monarch&rsquo;s risk in battle broil:-<br>
And in gay Holy-Rood, the while,<br>
Dame Heron rises with a smile<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the harp to play.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  295<br>
Fair was her rounded arm, as o&rsquo;er<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The strings her fingers flew;<br>
And as she touch&rsquo;d and tuned them all,<br>
Ever her bosom&rsquo;s rise and fall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was plainer given to view;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 300<br>
For, all for heat, was laid aside<br>
Her wimple, and her hood untied.<br>
And first she pitch&rsquo;d her voice to sing,<br>
Then glanced her dark eye on the King,<br>
And then around the silent ring;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  305<br>
And laugh&rsquo;d, and blush&rsquo;d, and oft did say<br>
Her pretty oath, by Yea, and Nay,<br>
She could not, would not, durst not play!<br>
At length, upon the harp, with glee,<br>
Mingled with arch simplicity,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 310<br>
A soft, yet lively, air she rung,<br>
While thus the wily lady sung:-<br>
<br>
<br>
XII.<br>
<br>
LOCHINVAR.<br>
<br>
Lady Heron&rsquo;s Song<br>
<br>
O, young Lochinvar is come out of the west,<br>
Through all the wide Border his steed was the best;<br>
And save his good broadsword, he weapons had none,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;  315<br>
He rode all unarm&rsquo;d, and he rode all alone.<br>
So faithful in love, and so dauntless in war,<br>
There never was knight like the young Lochinvar.<br>
<br>
He staid not for brake, and he stopp&rsquo;d not for stone,<br>
He swam the Eske river where ford there was none;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; 320<br>
But ere he alighted at Netherby gate,<br>
The bride had consented, the gallant came late:<br>
For a laggard in love, and a dastard in war,<br>
Was to wed the fair Ellen of brave Lochinvar.<br>
<br>
So boldly he enter&rsquo;d the Netherby Hall,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 325<br>
Among bride&rsquo;s-men, and kinsmen, and brothers, and all:<br>
Then spoke the bride&rsquo;s father, his hand on his sword,<br>
(For the poor craven bridegroom said never a word,)<br>
&lsquo;O come ye in peace here, or come ye in war,<br>
Or to dance at our bridal, young Lord Lochinvar?&rsquo;-&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; 330<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I long woo&rsquo;d your daughter, my suit you denied;-<br>
Love swells like the Solway, but ebbs like its tide-<br>
And now am I come, with this lost love of mine,<br>
To lead but one measure, drink one cup of wine.<br>
There are maidens in Scotland more lovely by far,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; 335<br>
That would gladly be bride to the young Lochinvar.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
The bride kiss&rsquo;d the goblet: the knight took it up,<br>
He quaff&rsquo;d off the wine, and he threw down the cup.<br>
She look&rsquo;d down to blush, and she look&rsquo;d up to sigh,<br>
With a smile on her lips, and a tear in her eye.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  340<br>
He took her soft hand, ere her mother could bar,-<br>
&lsquo;Now tread we a measure!&rsquo; said young Lochinvar.<br>
<br>
So stately his form, and so lovely her face,<br>
That never a hall such a galliard did grace;<br>
While her mother did fret, and her father did fume,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; 345<br>
And the bridegroom stood dangling his bonnet and plume;<br>
And the bride-maidens whisper&rsquo;d, &lsquo;&lsquo;Twere better by
far,<br>
To have match&rsquo;d our fair cousin with young Lochinvar.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
One touch to her hand, and one word in her ear,<br>
When they reach&rsquo;d the hall-door, and the charger stood near; 350<br>
So light to the croupe the fair lady he swung,<br>
So light to the saddle before her he sprung!<br>
&lsquo;She is won! we are gone, over bank, bush, and scaur;<br>
They&rsquo;ll have fleet steeds that follow,&rsquo; quoth young Lochinvar.<br>
<br>
There was mounting &lsquo;mong Graemes of the Netherby clan;&nbsp; &nbsp;
 355<br>
Forsters, Fenwicks, and Musgraves, they rode and they ran:<br>
There was racing and chasing, on Cannobie Lee,<br>
But the lost bride of Netherby ne&rsquo;er did they see.<br>
So daring in love, and so dauntless in war,<br>
Have ye e&rsquo;er heard of gallant like young Lochinvar?&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; 360<br>
<br>
<br>
XIII.<br>
<br>
The Monarch o&rsquo;er the siren hung,<br>
And beat the measure as she sung;<br>
And, pressing closer, and more near,<br>
He whisper&rsquo;d praises in her ear.<br>
In loud applause the courtiers vied;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  365<br>
And ladies wink&rsquo;d, and spoke aside.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The witching dame to Marmion threw<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A glance, where seem&rsquo;d to reign<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The pride that claims applauses due,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And of her royal conquest too,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  370<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A real or feign&rsquo;d disdain:<br>
Familiar was the look, and told,<br>
Marmion and she were friends of old.<br>
The King observed their meeting eyes,<br>
With something like displeased surprise;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  375<br>
For monarchs ill can rivals brook,<br>
Even in a word, or smile, or look.<br>
Straight took he forth the parchment broad,<br>
Which Marmion&rsquo;s high commission show&rsquo;d:<br>
&lsquo;Our Borders sack&rsquo;d by many a raid,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 380<br>
Our peaceful liege-men robb&rsquo;d,&rsquo; he said;<br>
&lsquo;On day of truce our Warden slain,<br>
Stout Barton kill&rsquo;d, his vessels ta&rsquo;en-<br>
Unworthy were we here to reign,<br>
Should these for vengeance cry in vain;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 385<br>
Our full defiance, hate, and scorn,<br>
Our herald has to Henry borne.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
XIV.<br>
<br>
He paused, and led where Douglas stood,<br>
And with stern eye the pageant view&rsquo;d:<br>
I mean that Douglas, sixth of yore,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 390<br>
Who coronet of Angus bore,<br>
And, when his blood and heart were high,<br>
Did the third James in camp defy,<br>
And all his minions led to die<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On Lauder&rsquo;s dreary flat:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  395<br>
Princes and favourites long grew tame,<br>
And trembled at the homely name<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Archibald Bell-the-Cat;<br>
The same who left the dusky vale<br>
Of Hermitage in Liddisdale,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
400<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Its dungeons, and its towers,<br>
Where Bothwell&rsquo;s turrets brave the air,<br>
And Bothwell bank is blooming fair,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To fix his princely bowers.<br>
Though now, in age, he had laid down&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  405<br>
His armour for the peaceful gown,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And for a staff his brand,<br>
Yet often would flash forth the fire,<br>
That could, in youth, a monarch&rsquo;s ire<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And minion&rsquo;s pride withstand;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; 410<br>
And even that day, at council board,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Unapt to soothe his sovereign&rsquo;s mood,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the war had Angus stood,<br>
And chafed his royal Lord.<br>
<br>
<br>
XV.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His giant-form, like ruin&rsquo;d tower,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  415<br>
Though fall&rsquo;n its muscles&rsquo; brawny vaunt,<br>
Huge-boned, and tall, and grim, and gaunt,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Seem&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er the gaudy scene to lower:<br>
His locks and beard in silver grew;<br>
His eyebrows kept their sable hue.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  420<br>
Near Douglas when the Monarch stood,<br>
His bitter speech he thus pursued :<br>
&lsquo;Lord Marmion, since these letters say<br>
That in the North you needs must stay,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;While slightest hopes of peace remain,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  425<br>
Uncourteous speech it were, and stern,<br>
To say-Return to Lindisfarne,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Until my herald come again.-<br>
Then rest you in Tantallon Hold;<br>
Your host shall be the Douglas bold,-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  430<br>
A chief unlike his sires of old.<br>
He wears their motto on his blade,<br>
Their blazon o&rsquo;er his towers display&rsquo;d;<br>
Yet loves his sovereign to oppose,<br>
More than to face his country&rsquo;s foes.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 435<br>
And, I bethink me, by Saint Stephen,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But e&rsquo;en this morn to me was given<br>
A prize, the first fruits of the war,<br>
Ta&rsquo;en by a galley from Dunbar,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A bevy of the maids of Heaven.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  440<br>
Under your guard, these holy maids<br>
Shall safe return to cloister shades,<br>
And, while they at Tantallon stay,<br>
Requiem for Cochran&rsquo;s soul may say.&rsquo;<br>
And, with the slaughter&rsquo;d favourite&rsquo;s name,&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 445<br>
Across the Monarch&rsquo;s brow there came<br>
A cloud of ire, remorse, and shame.<br>
<br>
<br>
XVI.<br>
<br>
In answer nought could Angus speak;<br>
His proud heart swell&rsquo;d wellnigh to break:<br>
He turn&rsquo;d aside, and down his cheek&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 450<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A burning tear there stole.<br>
His hand the Monarch sudden took,<br>
That sight his kind heart could not brook:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Now, by the Bruce&rsquo;s soul,<br>
Angus, my hasty speech forgive!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 455<br>
For sure as doth his spirit live,<br>
As he said of the Douglas old,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I well may say of you,-<br>
That never King did subject hold,<br>
In speech more free, in war more bold,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  460<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;More tender and more true:<br>
Forgive me, Douglas, once again.&rsquo;-<br>
And, while the King his hand did strain,<br>
The old man&rsquo;s tears fell down like rain.<br>
To seize the moment Marmion tried,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  465<br>
And whisper&rsquo;d to the King aside:<br>
&lsquo;Oh! let such tears unwonted plead<br>
For respite short from dubious deed!<br>
A child will weep a bramble&rsquo;s smart,<br>
A maid to see her sparrow part,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 470<br>
A stripling for a woman&rsquo;s heart:<br>
But woe awaits a country, when<br>
She sees the tears of bearded men.<br>
Then, oh! what omen, dark and high,<br>
When Douglas wets his manly eye!&rsquo;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 475<br>
<br>
<br>
XVII.<br>
<br>
Displeased was James, that stranger view&rsquo;d<br>
And tamper&rsquo;d with his changing mood.<br>
&lsquo;Laugh those that can, weep those that may,&rsquo;<br>
Thus did the fiery Monarch say,<br>
&lsquo;Southward I march by break of day;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 480<br>
And if within Tantallon strong,<br>
The good Lord Marmion tarries long,<br>
Perchance our meeting next may fall<br>
At Tamworth, in his castle-hall.&rsquo;-<br>
The haughty Marmion felt the taunt,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 485<br>
And answer&rsquo;d, grave, the royal vaunt:<br>
&lsquo;Much honour&rsquo;d were my humble home,<br>
If in its halls King James should come;<br>
But Nottingham has archers good,<br>
And Yorkshire men are stem of mood;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 490<br>
Northumbrian prickers wild and rude.<br>
On Derby Hills the paths are steep;<br>
In Ouse and Tyne the fords are deep;<br>
And many a banner will be torn,<br>
And many a knight to earth be borne,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  495<br>
And many a sheaf of arrows spent,<br>
Ere Scotland&rsquo;s King shall cross the Trent:<br>
Yet pause, brave Prince, while yet you may!&rsquo;-<br>
The Monarch lightly turn&rsquo;d away,<br>
And to his nobles loud did call,-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  500<br>
&lsquo;Lords, to the dance,-a hall! a hall!&rsquo;<br>
Himself his cloak and sword flung by,<br>
And led Dame Heron gallantly;<br>
And Minstrels, at the royal order,<br>
Rung out-&lsquo;Blue Bonnets o&rsquo;er the Border.&rsquo;&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 505<br>
<br>
<br>
XVIII.<br>
<br>
Leave we these revels now, to tell<br>
What to Saint Hilda&rsquo;s maids befell,<br>
Whose galley, as they sail&rsquo;d again<br>
To Whitby, by a Scot was ta&rsquo;en.<br>
Now at Dun-Edin did they bide,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  510<br>
Till James should of their fate decide;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And soon, by his command,<br>
Were gently summon&rsquo;d to prepare<br>
To journey under Marmion&rsquo;s care,<br>
As escort honour&rsquo;d, safe, and fair,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 515<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Again to English land.<br>
The Abbess told her chaplet o&rsquo;er,<br>
Nor knew which Saint she should implore;<br>
For, when she thought of Constance, sore<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She fear&rsquo;d Lord Marmion&rsquo;s mood.&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; 520<br>
And judge what Clara must have felt!<br>
The sword, that hung in Marmion&rsquo;s belt,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Had drunk De Wilton&rsquo;s blood.<br>
Unwittingly, King James had given,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As guard to Whitby&rsquo;s shades,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 525<br>
The man most dreaded under heaven<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By these defenceless maids:<br>
Yet what petition could avail,<br>
Or who would listen to the tale<br>
Of woman, prisoner, and nun,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  530<br>
Mid bustle of a war begun?<br>
They deem&rsquo;d it hopeless to avoid<br>
The convoy of their dangerous guide.<br>
<br>
<br>
XIX.<br>
<br>
Their lodging, so the King assign&rsquo;d,<br>
To Marmion&rsquo;s, as their guardian, join&rsquo;d;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  535<br>
And thus it fell, that, passing nigh,<br>
The Palmer caught the Abbess&rsquo; eye,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who warn&rsquo;d him by a scroll,<br>
She had a secret to reveal,<br>
That much concern&rsquo;d the Church&rsquo;s weal,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  540<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And health of sinner&rsquo;s soul;<br>
And, with deep charge of secrecy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She named a place to meet,<br>
Within an open balcony,<br>
That hung from dizzy pitch, and high,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 545<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Above the stately street;<br>
To which, as common to each home,<br>
At night they might in secret come.<br>
<br>
<br>
XX.<br>
<br>
At night, in secret, there they came,<br>
The Palmer and the holy dame.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 550<br>
The moon among the clouds rose high,<br>
And all the city hum was by.<br>
Upon the street, where late before<br>
Did din of war and warriors roar,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You might have heard a pebble fall,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 555<br>
A beetle hum, a cricket sing,<br>
An owlet flap his boding wing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On Giles&rsquo;s steeple tall.<br>
The antique buildings, climbing high,<br>
Whose Gothic frontlets sought the sky,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  560<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were here wrapt deep in shade;<br>
There on their brows the moon-beam broke,<br>
Through the faint wreaths of silvery smoke,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the casements play&rsquo;d.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And other light was none to see,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  565<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save torches gliding far,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Before some chieftain of degree,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who left the royal revelry<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bowne him for the war.-<br>
A solemn scene the Abbess chose;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  570<br>
A solemn hour, her secret to disclose.<br>
<br>
<br>
XXI.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;O, holy Palmer!&rsquo; she began,-<br>
&lsquo;For sure he must be sainted man,<br>
Whose blessed feet have trod the ground<br>
Where the Redeemer&rsquo;s tomb is found,-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 575<br>
For His dear Church&rsquo;s sake, my tale<br>
Attend, nor deem of light avail,<br>
Though I must speak of worldly love,-<br>
How vain to those who wed above!-<br>
De Wilton and Lord Marmion woo&rsquo;d&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  580<br>
Clara de Clare, of Gloster&rsquo;s blood;<br>
(Idle it were of Whitby&rsquo;s dame,<br>
To say of that same blood I came;)<br>
And once, when jealous rage was high,<br>
Lord Marmion said despiteously,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 585<br>
Wilton was traitor in his heart,<br>
And had made league with Martin Swart,<br>
When he came here on Simnel&rsquo;s part;<br>
And only cowardice did restrain<br>
His rebel aid on Stokefield&rsquo;s plain,-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  590<br>
And down he threw his glove:-the thing<br>
Was tried, as wont, before the King;<br>
Where frankly did De Wilton own,<br>
That Swart in Guelders he had known;<br>
And that between them then there went&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 595<br>
Some scroll of courteous compliment.<br>
For this he to his castle sent;<br>
But when his messenger return&rsquo;d,<br>
Judge how De Wilton&rsquo;s fury burn&rsquo;d!<br>
For in his packet there were laid&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 600<br>
Letters that claim&rsquo;d disloyal aid,<br>
And proved King Henry&rsquo;s cause betray&rsquo;d.<br>
His fame, thus blighted, in the field<br>
He strove to clear, by spear and shield;-<br>
To clear his fame in vain he strove,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  605<br>
For wondrous are His ways above!<br>
Perchance some form was unobserved;<br>
Perchance in prayer, or faith, he swerved;<br>
Else how could guiltless champion quail,<br>
Or how the blessed ordeal fail?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 610<br>
<br>
<br>
XXII.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;His squire, who now De Wilton saw<br>
As recreant doom&rsquo;d to suffer law,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Repentant, own&rsquo;d in vain,<br>
That, while he had the scrolls in care,<br>
A stranger maiden, passing fair,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  615<br>
Had drench&rsquo;d him with a beverage rare;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His words no faith could gain.<br>
With Clare alone he credence won,<br>
Who, rather than wed Marmion,<br>
Did to Saint Hilda&rsquo;s shrine repair,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 620<br>
To give our house her livings fair,<br>
And die a vestal vot&rsquo;ress there.<br>
The impulse from the earth was given,<br>
But bent her to the paths of heaven.<br>
A purer heart, a lovelier maid,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 625<br>
Ne&rsquo;er shelter&rsquo;d her in Whitby&rsquo;s shade,<br>
No, not since Saxon Edelfled;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Only one trace of earthly strain,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That for her lover&rsquo;s loss<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She cherishes a sorrow vain,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 630<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And murmurs at the cross.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And then her heritage;-it goes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the banks of Tame;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep fields of grain the reaper mows,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In meadows rich the heifer lows,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  635<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The falconer and huntsman knows<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its woodlands for the game.<br>
Shame were it to Saint Hilda dear,<br>
And I, her humble vot&rsquo;ress here,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Should do a deadly sin,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; 640<br>
Her temple spoil&rsquo;d before mine eyes,<br>
If this false Marmion such a prize<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By my consent should win;<br>
Yet hath our boisterous monarch sworn,<br>
That Clare shall from our house be torn;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  645<br>
And grievous cause have I to fear,<br>
Such mandate doth Lord Marmion bear.<br>
<br>
<br>
XXIII.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Now, prisoner, helpless, and betray&rsquo;d<br>
To evil power, I claim thine aid,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By every step that thou hast trod&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 650<br>
To holy shrine and grotto dim,<br>
By every martyr&rsquo;s tortured limb,<br>
By angel, saint, and seraphim,<br>
And by the Church of God!<br>
For mark:-When Wilton was betray&rsquo;d,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  655<br>
And with his squire forged letters laid,<br>
She was, alas! that sinful maid,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By whom the deed was done,-<br>
Oh! shame and horror to be said!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She was a perjured nun!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; 660<br>
No clerk in all the land, like her,<br>
Traced quaint and varying character.<br>
Perchance you may a marvel deem,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That Marmion&rsquo;s paramour<br>
(For such vile thing she was) should scheme&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 665<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her lover&rsquo;s nuptial hour;<br>
But o&rsquo;er him thus she hoped to gain,<br>
As privy to his honour&rsquo;s stain,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Illimitable power:<br>
For this she secretly retain&rsquo;d&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  670<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Each proof that might the plot reveal,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Instructions with his hand and seal;<br>
And thus Saint Hilda deign&rsquo;d,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Through sinners&rsquo; perfidy impure,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her house&rsquo;s glory to secure,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 675<br>
And Clare&rsquo;s immortal weal.<br>
<br>
<br>
XXIV.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Twere long, and needless, here to tell,<br>
How to my hand these papers fell;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With me they must not stay.<br>
Saint Hilda keep her Abbess true!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 680<br>
Who knows what outrage he might do,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;While journeying by the way?-<br>
O, blessed Saint, if e&rsquo;er again<br>
I venturous leave thy calm domain,<br>
To travel or by land or main,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 685<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep penance may I pay!-<br>
Now, saintly Palmer, mark my prayer:<br>
I give this packet to thy care,<br>
For thee to stop they will not dare;<br>
And O! with cautious speed,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
690<br>
To Wolsey&rsquo;s hand the papers &lsquo;bring,<br>
That he may show them to the King:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And, for thy well-earn&rsquo;d meed,<br>
Thou holy man, at Whitby&rsquo;s shrine<br>
A weekly mass shall still be thine,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 695<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;While priests can sing and read.<br>
What ail&rsquo;st thou?-Speak!&rsquo;-For as he took<br>
The charge, a strong emotion shook<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His frame; and, ere reply,<br>
They heard a faint, yet shrilly tone,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 700<br>
Like distant clarion feebly blown,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That on the breeze did die;<br>
And loud the Abbess shriek&rsquo;d in fear,<br>
&lsquo;Saint Withold, save us!-What is here!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at yon City Cross!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; 705<br>
See on its battled tower appear<br>
Phantoms, that scutcheons seem to rear,<br>
And blazon&rsquo;d banners toss!&rsquo;-<br>
<br>
<br>
XXV.<br>
<br>
Dun-Edin&rsquo;s Cross, a pillar&rsquo;d stone,<br>
Rose on a turret octagon;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
710<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(But now is razed that monument,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whence royal edict rang,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And voice of Scotland&rsquo;s law was sent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In glorious trumpet-clang.<br>
O! be his tomb as lead to lead,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 715<br>
Upon its dull destroyer&rsquo;s head!-<br>
A minstrel&rsquo;s malison is said.)-<br>
Then on its battlements they saw<br>
A vision, passing Nature&rsquo;s law,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Strange, wild, and dimly seen;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  720<br>
Figures that seem&rsquo;d to rise and die,<br>
Gibber and sign, advance and fly,<br>
While nought confirm&rsquo;d could ear or eye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Discern of sound or mien.<br>
Yet darkly did it seem, as there&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  725<br>
Heralds and Pursuivants prepare,<br>
With trumpet sound, and blazon fair,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A summons to proclaim;<br>
But indistinct the pageant proud,<br>
As fancy forms of midnight cloud,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 730<br>
When flings the moon upon her shroud<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A wavering tinge of flame;<br>
It flits, expands, and shifts, till loud,<br>
From midmost of the spectre crowd,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This awful summons came:-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 735<br>
<br>
<br>
XXVI.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Prince, prelate, potentate, and peer,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose names I now shall call,<br>
Scottish, or foreigner, give ear!<br>
Subjects of him who sent me here,<br>
At his tribunal to appear,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 740<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I summon one and all:<br>
I cite you by each deadly sin,<br>
That e&rsquo;er hath soil&rsquo;d your hearts within;<br>
I cite you by each brutal lust,<br>
That e&rsquo;er defiled your earthly dust,-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  745<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By wrath, by pride, by fear,<br>
By each o&rsquo;er-mastering passion&rsquo;s tone,<br>
By the dark grave, and dying groan!<br>
When forty days are pass&rsquo;d and gone,<br>
I cite you at your Monarch&rsquo;s throne,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  750<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer and appear.&rsquo;-<br>
Then thundered forth a roll of names:-<br>
The first was thine, unhappy James!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then all thy nobles came;<br>
Crawford, Glencairn, Montrose, Argyle,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  755<br>
Ross, Bothwell, Forbes, Lennox, Lyle,<br>
Why should I tell their separate style?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Each chief of birth and fame,<br>
Of Lowland, Highland, Border, Isle,<br>
Fore-doom&rsquo;d to Flodden&rsquo;s carnage pile,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  760<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was cited there by name;<br>
And Marmion, Lord of Fontenaye,<br>
Of Lutterward, and Scrivelbaye;<br>
De Wilton, erst of Aberley,<br>
The self-same thundering voice did say.-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 765<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But then another spoke:<br>
&lsquo;Thy fatal summons I deny,<br>
And thine infernal Lord defy,<br>
Appealing me to Him on high,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who burst the sinner&rsquo;s yoke.&rsquo;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; 770<br>
At that dread accent, with a scream,<br>
Parted the pageant like a dream,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The summoner was gone.<br>
Prone on her face the Abbess fell,<br>
And fast, and fast, her beads did tell;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 775<br>
Her nuns came, startled by the yell,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And found her there alone.<br>
She mark&rsquo;d not, at the scene aghast,<br>
What time, or how, the Palmer pass&rsquo;d.<br>
<br>
<br>
XXVII.<br>
<br>
Shift we the scene.-The camp doth move,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  780<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dun-Edin&rsquo;s streets are empty now,<br>
Save when, for weal of those they love,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To pray the prayer, and vow the vow,<br>
The tottering child, the anxious fair,<br>
The grey-hair&rsquo;d sire, with pious care,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  785<br>
To chapels and to shrines repair-<br>
Where is the Palmer now? and where<br>
The Abbess, Marmion, and Clare?-<br>
Bold Douglas! to Tantallon fair<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They journey in thy charge:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
790<br>
Lord Marmion rode on his right hand,<br>
The Palmer still was with the band;<br>
Angus, like Lindesay, did command,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That none should roam at large.<br>
But in that Palmer&rsquo;s altered mien&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 795<br>
A wondrous change might now be seen;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Freely he spoke of war,<br>
Of marvels wrought by single hand,<br>
When lifted for a native land;<br>
And still look&rsquo;d high, as if he plann&rsquo;d&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 800<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some desperate deed afar.<br>
His courser would he feed and stroke,<br>
And, tucking up his sable frocke,<br>
Would first his mettle bold provoke,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then soothe or quell his pride.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 805<br>
Old Hubert said, that never one<br>
He saw, except Lord Marmion,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A steed so fairly ride.<br>
<br>
<br>
XXVIII.<br>
<br>
Some half-hour&rsquo;s march behind, there came,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By Eustace govern&rsquo;d fair,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; 810<br>
A troop escorting Hilda&rsquo;s Dame,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With all her nuns, and Clare.<br>
No audience had Lord Marmion sought;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever he fear&rsquo;d to aggravate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Clara de Clare&rsquo;s suspicious hate;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 815<br>
And safer &lsquo;twas, he thought,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To wait till, from the nuns removed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The influence of kinsmen loved,<br>
And suit by Henry&rsquo;s self approved,<br>
Her slow consent had wrought.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 820<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His was no flickering flame, that dies<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless when fann&rsquo;d by looks and sighs,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And lighted oft at lady&rsquo;s eyes;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He long&rsquo;d to stretch his wide command<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O&rsquo;er luckless Clara&rsquo;s ample land:&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
825<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, when Wilton with him vied,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the pang of humbled pride<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The place of jealousy supplied,<br>
Yet conquest, by that meanness won<br>
He almost loath&rsquo;d to think upon,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  830<br>
Led him, at times, to hate the cause,<br>
Which made him burst through honour&rsquo;s laws.<br>
If e&rsquo;er he loved, &lsquo;twas her alone,<br>
Who died within that vault of stone.<br>
<br>
<br>
XXIX.<br>
<br>
And now, when close at hand they saw&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  835<br>
North Berwick&rsquo;s town, and lofty Law,<br>
Fitz-Eustace bade them pause a while,<br>
Before a venerable pile,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose turrets view&rsquo;d, afar,<br>
The lofty Bass, the Lambie Isle,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  840<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The ocean&rsquo;s peace or war.<br>
At tolling of a bell, forth came<br>
The convent&rsquo;s venerable Dame,<br>
And pray&rsquo;d Saint Hilda&rsquo;s Abbess rest<br>
With her, a loved and honour&rsquo;d guest,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 845<br>
Till Douglas should a bark prepare<br>
To wait her back to Whitby fair.<br>
Glad was the Abbess, you may guess,<br>
And thank&rsquo;d the Scottish Prioress;<br>
And tedious were to tell, I ween,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 850<br>
The courteous speech that pass&rsquo;d between.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O&rsquo;erjoy&rsquo;d the nuns their palfreys leave;<br>
But when fair Clara did intend,<br>
Like them, from horseback to descend,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fitz-Eustace said,-&rsquo;I grieve,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 855<br>
Fair lady, grieve e&rsquo;en from my heart,<br>
Such gentle company to part;-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Think not discourtesy,<br>
But lords&rsquo; commands must be obey&rsquo;d;<br>
And Marmion and the Douglas said,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 860<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That you must wend with me.<br>
Lord Marmion hath a letter broad,<br>
Which to the Scottish Earl he show&rsquo;d,<br>
Commanding, that, beneath his care,<br>
Without delay, you shall repair&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 865<br>
To your good kinsman, Lord Fitz-Clare.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
XXX.<br>
<br>
The startled Abbess loud exclaim&rsquo;d;<br>
But she, at whom the blow was aim&rsquo;d,<br>
Grew pale as death, and cold as lead,-<br>
She deem&rsquo;d she heard her death-doom read.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 870<br>
&lsquo;Cheer thee, my child!&rsquo; the Abbess said,<br>
&lsquo;They dare not tear thee from my hand,<br>
To ride alone with armed band.&rsquo;-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Nay, holy mother, nay,&rsquo;<br>
Fitz-Eustace said, &lsquo;the lovely Clare&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  875<br>
Will be in Lady Angus&rsquo; care,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In Scotland while we stay;<br>
And, when we move, an easy ride<br>
Will bring us to the English side,<br>
Female attendance to provide&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  880<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Befitting Gloster&rsquo;s heir;<br>
Nor thinks, nor dreams, my noble lord,<br>
By slightest look, or act, or word,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To harass Lady Clare.<br>
Her faithful guardian he will be,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 885<br>
Nor sue for slightest courtesy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That e&rsquo;en to stranger falls,<br>
Till he shall place her, safe and free,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Within her kinsman&rsquo;s halls.&rsquo;<br>
He spoke, and blush&rsquo;d with earnest grace;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 890<br>
His faith was painted on his face,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Clare&rsquo;s worst fear relieved.<br>
The Lady Abbess loud exclaim&rsquo;d<br>
On Henry, and the Douglas blamed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Entreated, threaten&rsquo;d, grieved;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
895<br>
To martyr, saint, and prophet pray&rsquo;d,<br>
Against Lord Marmion inveigh&rsquo;d,<br>
And call&rsquo;d the Prioress to aid,<br>
To curse with candle, bell, and book.<br>
Her head the grave Cistertian shook:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  900<br>
&lsquo;The Douglas, and the King,&rsquo; she said,<br>
&lsquo;In their commands will be obey&rsquo;d;<br>
Grieve not, nor dream that harm can fall<br>
The maiden in Tantallon hall.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
XXXI.<br>
<br>
The Abbess, seeing strife was vain,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 905<br>
Assumed her wonted state again,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For much of state she had,-<br>
Composed her veil, and raised her head,<br>
And-&lsquo;Bid,&rsquo; in solemn voice she said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Thy master, bold and bad,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;  910<br>
The records of his house turn o&rsquo;er,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And, when he shall there written see,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That one of his own ancestry<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Drove the monks forth of Coventry,<br>
Bid him his fate explore!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
915<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Prancing in pride of earthly trust,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His charger hurl&rsquo;d him to the dust,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And, by a base plebeian thrust,<br>
He died his band before.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;God judge &lsquo;twixt Marmion and me;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  920<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a Chief of high degree,<br>
And I a poor recluse;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet oft, in holy writ, we see<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Even such weak minister as me<br>
May the oppressor bruise:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
925<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For thus, inspired, did Judith slay<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mighty in his sin,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Jael thus, and Deborah&rsquo;-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here hasty Blount broke in:<br>
&lsquo;Fitz-Eustace, we must march our band;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  930<br>
Saint Anton&rsquo; fire thee! wilt thou stand<br>
All day, with bonnet in thy hand,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To hear the Lady preach?<br>
By this good light! if thus we stay,<br>
Lord Marmion, for our fond delay,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 935<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Will sharper sermon teach.<br>
Come, don thy cap, and mount thy horse;<br>
The Dame must patience take perforce.&rsquo;-<br>
<br>
<br>
XXXII.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Submit we then to force,&rsquo; said Clare,<br>
&lsquo;But let this barbarous lord despair&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  940<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His purposed aim to win;<br>
Let him take living, land, and life;<br>
But to be Marmion&rsquo;s wedded wife<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In me were deadly sin:<br>
And if it be the King&rsquo;s decree,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 945<br>
That I must find no sanctuary,<br>
In that inviolable dome,<br>
Where even a homicide might come,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And safely rest his head,<br>
Though at its open portals stood,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 950<br>
Thirsting to pour forth blood for blood,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The kinsmen of the dead;<br>
Yet one asylum is my own<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the dreaded hour;<br>
A low, a silent, and a lone,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  955<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where kings have little power.<br>
One victim is before me there.-<br>
Mother, your blessing, and in prayer<br>
Remember your unhappy Clare!&rsquo;<br>
Loud weeps the Abbess, and bestows&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  960<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Kind blessings many a one:<br>
Weeping and wailing loud arose,<br>
Round patient Clare, the clamorous woes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of every simple nun.<br>
His eyes the gentle Eustace dried,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  965<br>
And scarce rude Blount the sight could bide.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then took the squire her rein,<br>
And gently led away her steed,<br>
And, by each courteous word and deed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To cheer her strove in vain.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 970<br>
<br>
<br>
XXXIII.<br>
<br>
But scant three miles the band had rode,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When o&rsquo;er a height they pass&rsquo;d,<br>
And, sudden, close before them show&rsquo;d<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His towers, Tantallon vast;<br>
Broad, massive, high, and stretching far,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 975<br>
And held impregnable in war.<br>
On a projecting rock they rose,<br>
And round three sides the ocean flows,<br>
The fourth did battled walls enclose,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And double mound and fosse.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
980<br>
By narrow drawbridge, outworks strong,<br>
Through studded gates, an entrance long,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To the main court they cross.<br>
It was a wide and stately square:<br>
Around were lodgings, fit and fair,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 985<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And towers of various form,<br>
Which on the court projected far,<br>
And broke its lines quadrangular.<br>
Here was square keep, there turret high,<br>
Or pinnacle that sought the sky,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  990<br>
Whence oft the Warder could descry<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The gathering ocean-storm.<br>
<br>
<br>
XXXIV.<br>
<br>
Here did they rest.-The princely care<br>
Of Douglas, why should I declare,<br>
Or say they met reception fair?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 995<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or why the tidings say,<br>
Which, varying, to Tantallon came,<br>
By hurrying posts, or fleeter fame,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With every varying day?<br>
And, first, they heard King James had won&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  1000<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Etall, and Wark, and Ford; and then,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That Norham Castle strong was ta&rsquo;en.<br>
At that sore marvell&rsquo;d Marmion;-<br>
And Douglas hoped his Monarch&rsquo;s hand<br>
Would soon subdue Northumberland:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  1005<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But whisper&rsquo;d news there came,<br>
That, while his host inactive lay,<br>
And melted by degrees away,<br>
King James was dallying off the day<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With Heron&rsquo;s wily dame.-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;  1010<br>
Such acts to chronicles I yield;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Go seek them there, and see:<br>
Mine is a tale of Flodden Field,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And not a history.-<br>
At length they heard the Scottish host&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1015<br>
On that high ridge had made their post,<br>
&nbsp;Which frowns o&rsquo;er Millfield Plain;<br>
And that brave Surrey many a band<br>
Had gather&rsquo;d in the Southern land,<br>
And march&rsquo;d into Northumberland,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1020<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And camp at Wooler ta&rsquo;en.<br>
Marmion, like charger in the stall,<br>
That hears, without, the trumpet-call,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Began to chafe, and swear:-<br>
&lsquo;A sorry thing to hide my head&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1025<br>
In castle, like a fearful maid,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When such a field is near!<br>
Needs must I see this battle-day:<br>
Death to my fame if such a fray<br>
Were fought, and Marmion away!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1030<br>
The Douglas, too, I wot not why,<br>
Hath &lsquo;bated of his courtesy:<br>
No longer in his halls I&rsquo;ll stay.&rsquo;<br>
Then bade his band they should array<br>
For march against the dawning day.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1035<br>

<b>INTRODUCTION TO CANTO SIXTH</b>.<br>
<br>
<i>TO RICHARD HEBER, ESQ.<br>
<br>
Mertoun-House, Christmas</i>.<br>
<br>
Heap on more wood!-the wind is chill;<br>
But let it whistle as it will,<br>
We&rsquo;ll keep our Christmas merry still.<br>
Each age has deem&rsquo;d the new-born year<br>
The fittest time for festal cheer:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  5<br>
Even, heathen yet, the savage Dane<br>
At Iol more deep the mead did drain;<br>
High on the beach his galleys drew,<br>
And feasted all his pirate crew;<br>
Then in his low and pine-built hall,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 10<br>
Where shields and axes deck&rsquo;d the wall,<br>
They gorged upon the half-dress&rsquo;d steer;<br>
Caroused in seas of sable beer;<br>
While round, in brutal jest, were thrown<br>
The half-gnaw&rsquo;d rib, and marrow-bone,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  15<br>
Or listen&rsquo;d all, in grim delight,<br>
While scalds yell&rsquo;d out the joys of fight.<br>
Then forth, in frenzy, would they hie,<br>
While wildly-loose their red locks fly,<br>
And dancing round the blazing pile,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  20<br>
They make such barbarous mirth the while,<br>
As best might to the mind recall<br>
The boisterous joys of Odin&rsquo;s hall.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And well our Christian sires of old<br>
Loved when the year its course had roll&rsquo;d,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 25<br>
And brought blithe Christmas back again,<br>
With all his hospitable train.<br>
Domestic and religious rite<br>
Gave honour to the holy night;<br>
On Christmas eve the bells were rung;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  30<br>
On Christmas eve the mass was sung:<br>
That only night in all the year,<br>
Saw the stoled priest the chalice rear.<br>
The damsel donn&rsquo;d her kirtle sheen;<br>
The hall was dress&rsquo;d with holly green;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 35<br>
Forth to the wood did merry-men go,<br>
To gather in the mistletoe.<br>
Then open&rsquo;d wide the Baron&rsquo;s hall<br>
To vassal, tenant, serf, and all;<br>
Power laid his rod of rule aside,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  40<br>
And Ceremony doff&rsquo;d his pride.<br>
The heir, with roses in his shoes,<br>
That night might village partner choose;<br>
The Lord, underogating, share<br>
The vulgar game of &lsquo;post and pair.&rsquo;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  45<br>
All hail&rsquo;d, with uncontroll&rsquo;d delight,<br>
And general voice, the happy night,<br>
That to the cottage, as the crown,<br>
Brought tidings of salvation down.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire, with well-dried logs supplied,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 50<br>
Went roaring up the chimney wide:<br>
The huge hall-table&rsquo;s oaken face,<br>
Scrubb&rsquo;d till it shone, the day to grace,<br>
Bore then upon its massive board<br>
No mark to part the squire and lord.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 55<br>
Then was brought in the lusty brawn,<br>
By old blue-coated serving-man;<br>
Then the grim boar&rsquo;s head frown&rsquo;d on high,<br>
Crested with bays and rosemary.<br>
Well can the green-garb&rsquo;d ranger tell,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 60<br>
How, when, and where, the monster fell;<br>
What dogs before his death he tore,<br>
And all the baiting of the boar.<br>
The wassel round, in good brown bowls,<br>
Garnish&rsquo;d with ribbons, blithely trowls.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 65<br>
There the huge sirloin reek&rsquo;d; hard by<br>
Plum-porridge stood, and Christmas pie:<br>
Nor fail&rsquo;d old Scotland to produce,<br>
At such high tide, her savoury goose.<br>
Then came the merry maskers in,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  70<br>
And carols roar&rsquo;d with blithesome din;<br>
If unmelodious was the song,<br>
It was a hearty note, and strong.<br>
Who lists may in their mumming see<br>
Traces of ancient mystery;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; 75<br>
White shirts supplied the masquerade,<br>
And smutted cheeks the visors made;<br>
But, O! what maskers, richly dight,<br>
Can boast of bosoms half so light!<br>
England was merry England, when&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  80<br>
Old Christmas brought his sports again.<br>
&lsquo;Twas Christmas broach&rsquo;d the mightiest ale;<br>
&lsquo;Twas Christmas told the merriest tale;<br>
A Christmas gambol oft could cheer<br>
The poor man&rsquo;s heart through half the year.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  85<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Still linger, in our northern clime,<br>
Some remnants of the good old time;<br>
And still, within our valleys here,<br>
We hold the kindred title dear,<br>
Even when, perchance, its far-fetch&rsquo;d claim&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  90<br>
To Southron ear sounds empty name;<br>
For course of blood, our proverbs deem,<br>
Is warmer than the mountain-stream.<br>
And thus, my Christmas still I hold<br>
Where my great-grandsire came of old,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  95<br>
With amber beard, and flaxen hair,<br>
And reverend apostolic air-<br>
The feast and holy-tide to share,<br>
And mix sobriety with wine,<br>
And honest mirth with thoughts divine:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  100<br>
Small thought was his, in after time<br>
E&rsquo;er to be hitch&rsquo;d into a rhyme.<br>
The simple sire could only boast,<br>
That he was loyal to his cost;<br>
The banish&rsquo;d race of kings revered,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 105<br>
And lost his land,-but kept his beard.<br>
<br>
In these dear halls, where welcome kind<br>
Is with fair liberty combined;<br>
Where cordial friendship gives the hand,<br>
And flies constraint the magic wand&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 110<br>
Of the fair dame that rules the land.<br>
Little we heed the tempest drear,<br>
While music, mirth, and social cheer,<br>
Speed on their wings the passing year.<br>
And Mertoun&rsquo;s halls are fair e&rsquo;en now,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  115<br>
When not a leaf is on the bough.<br>
Tweed loves them well, and turns again,<br>
As loth to leave the sweet domain,<br>
And holds his mirror to her face,<br>
And clips her with a close embrace:-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 120<br>
Gladly as he, we seek the dome,<br>
And as reluctant turn us home.<br>
<br>
How just that, at this time of glee,<br>
My thoughts should, Heber, turn to thee!<br>
For many a merry hour we&rsquo;ve known,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  125<br>
And heard the chimes of midnight&rsquo;s tone.<br>
Cease, then, my friend! a moment cease,<br>
And leave these classic tomes in peace!<br>
Of Roman and of Grecian lore,<br>
Sure mortal brain can hold no more.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 130<br>
These ancients, as Noll Bluff might say,<br>
&lsquo;Were pretty fellows in their day;&rsquo;<br>
But time and tide o&rsquo;er all prevail-<br>
On Christmas eve a Christmas tale-<br>
Of wonder and of war-&lsquo;Profane!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 135<br>
What! leave the lofty Latian strain,<br>
Her stately prose, her verse&rsquo;s charms,<br>
To hear the clash of rusty arms:<br>
In Fairy Land or Limbo lost,<br>
To jostle conjurer and ghost,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 140<br>
Goblin and witch!&rsquo;-Nay, Heber dear,<br>
Before you touch my charter, hear;<br>
Though Leyden aids, alas! no more,<br>
My cause with many-languaged lore,<br>
This may I say:-in realms of death&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 145<br>
Ulysses meets Alcides&rsquo; <i>wraith</i>;<br>
Aeneas, upon Thracia&rsquo;s shore,<br>
The ghost of murder&rsquo;d Polydore;<br>
For omens, we in Livy cross,<br>
At every turn, <i>locutus Bos</i>.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; 150<br>
As grave and duly speaks that ox,<br>
As if he told the price of stocks;<br>
Or held, in Rome republican,<br>
The place of Common-councilman.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All nations have their omens drear,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 155<br>
Their legends wild of woe and fear.<br>
To Cambria look-the peasant see,<br>
Bethink him of Glendowerdy,<br>
And shun &lsquo;the Spirit&rsquo;s Blasted Tree.&rsquo;<br>
The Highlander, whose red claymore&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  160<br>
The battle turn&rsquo;d on Maida&rsquo;s shore,<br>
Will, on a Friday morn, look pale,<br>
If ask&rsquo;d to tell a fairy tale:<br>
He fears the vengeful Elfin King,<br>
Who leaves that day his grassy ring:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  165<br>
Invisible to human ken,<br>
He walks among the sons of men.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Did&rsquo;st e&rsquo;er, dear Heber, pass along<br>
Beneath the towers of Franchemont,<br>
Which, like an eagle&rsquo;s nest in air,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 170<br>
Hang o&rsquo;er the stream and hamlet fair?<br>
Deep in their vaults, the peasants say,<br>
A mighty treasure buried lay,<br>
Amass&rsquo;d through rapine and through wrong<br>
By the last Lord of Franchemont.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  175<br>
The iron chest is bolted hard,<br>
A Huntsman sits, its constant guard;<br>
Around his neck his horn is hung,<br>
His hanger in his belt is slung;<br>
Before his feet his blood-hounds lie:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 180<br>
An &lsquo;twere not for his gloomy eye,<br>
Whose withering glance no heart can brook,<br>
As true a huntsman doth he look,<br>
As bugle e&rsquo;er in brake did sound,<br>
Or ever hollow&rsquo;d to a hound.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 185<br>
To chase the fiend, and win the prize,<br>
In that same dungeon ever tries<br>
An aged Necromantic Priest;<br>
It is an hundred years at least,<br>
Since &lsquo;twixt them first the strife begun,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 190<br>
And neither yet has lost nor won.<br>
And oft the Conjurer&rsquo;s words will make<br>
The stubborn Demon groan and quake;<br>
And oft the bands of iron break,<br>
Or bursts one lock, that still amain,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 195<br>
Fast as &lsquo;tis open&rsquo;d, shuts again.<br>
That magic strife within the tomb<br>
May last until the day of doom,<br>
Unless the Adept shall learn to tell<br>
The very word that clench&rsquo;d the spell,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  200<br>
When Franch&rsquo;mont lock&rsquo;d the treasure cell.<br>
An hundred years are pass&rsquo;d and gone,<br>
And scarce three letters has he won.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Such general superstition may<br>
Excuse for old Pitscottie say;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  205<br>
Whose gossip history has given<br>
My song the messenger from Heaven,<br>
That warn&rsquo;d, in Lithgow, Scotland&rsquo;s King,<br>
Nor less the infernal summoning;<br>
May pass the Monk of Durham&rsquo;s tale,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 210<br>
Whose Demon fought in Gothic mail;<br>
May pardon plead for Fordun grave,<br>
Who told of Gifford&rsquo;s Goblin-Cave.<br>
But why such instances to you,<br>
Who, in an instant, can renew&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 215<br>
Your treasured hoards of various lore,<br>
And furnish twenty thousand more?<br>
Hoards, not like theirs whose volumes rest<br>
Like treasures in the Franch&rsquo;mont chest,<br>
While gripple owners still refuse&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 220<br>
To others what they cannot use;<br>
Give them the priest&rsquo;s whole century,<br>
They shall not spell you letters three;<br>
Their pleasure in the books the same<br>
The magpie takes in pilfer&rsquo;d gem.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 225<br>
Thy volumes, open as thy heart,<br>
Delight, amusement, science, art,<br>
To every ear and eye impart;<br>
Yet who, of all who thus employ them,<br>
Can like the owner&rsquo;s self enjoy them?-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 230<br>
But, hark! I hear the distant drum!<br>
The day of Flodden Field is come.-<br>
Adieu, dear Heber! life and health,<br>
And store of literary wealth.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>CANTO SIXTH</b>.<br>
<br>
THE BATTLE.<br>
<br>
<br>
While great events were on the gale,<br>
And each hour brought a varying tale,<br>
And the demeanour, changed and cold,<br>
Of Douglas, fretted Marmion bold,<br>
And, like the impatient steed of war,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5<br>
He snuff&rsquo;d the battle from afar;<br>
And hopes were none, that back again<br>
Herald should come from Terouenne,<br>
Where England&rsquo;s King in leaguer lay,<br>
Before decisive battle-day;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 10<br>
Whilst these things were, the mournful Clare<br>
Did in the Dame&rsquo;s devotions share:<br>
For the good Countess ceaseless pray&rsquo;d<br>
To Heaven and Saints, her sons to aid.<br>
And, with short interval, did pass&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 15<br>
From prayer to book, from book to mass,<br>
And all in high Baronial pride,-<br>
A life both dull and dignified;-<br>
Yet as Lord Marmion nothing press&rsquo;d<br>
Upon her intervals of rest,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 20<br>
Dejected Clara well could bear<br>
The formal state, the lengthen&rsquo;d prayer,<br>
Though dearest to her wounded heart<br>
The hours that she might spend apart.<br>
<br>
<br>
II.<br>
<br>
I said, Tantallon&rsquo;s dizzy steep&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  25<br>
Hung o&rsquo;er the margin of the deep.<br>
Many a rude tower and rampart there<br>
Repell&rsquo;d the insult of the air,<br>
Which, when the tempest vex&rsquo;d the sky,<br>
Half breeze, half spray, came whistling by.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  30<br>
Above the rest, a turret square<br>
Did o&rsquo;er its Gothic entrance bear,<br>
Of sculpture rude, a stony shield;<br>
The Bloody Heart was in the Field,<br>
And in the chief three mullets stood,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  35<br>
The cognizance of Douglas blood.<br>
The turret held a narrow stair,<br>
Which, mounted, gave you access where<br>
A parapet&rsquo;s embattled row<br>
Did seaward round the castle go.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 40<br>
Sometimes in dizzy steps descending,<br>
Sometimes in narrow circuit bending,<br>
Sometimes in platform broad extending,<br>
Its varying circle did combine<br>
Bulwark, and bartisan, and line,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 45<br>
And bastion, tower, and vantage-coign:<br>
Above the booming ocean leant<br>
The far-projecting battlement;<br>
The billows burst, in ceaseless flow,<br>
Upon the precipice below.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 50<br>
Where&rsquo;er Tantallon faced the land,<br>
Gate-works, and walls, were strongly mann&rsquo;d;<br>
No need upon the sea-girt side;<br>
The steepy rock, and frantic tide,<br>
Approach of human step denied;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 55<br>
And thus these lines, and ramparts rude,<br>
Were left in deepest solitude.<br>
<br>
<br>
III.<br>
<br>
And, for they were so lonely, Clare<br>
Would to these battlements repair,<br>
And muse upon her sorrows there,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 60<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And list the sea-bird&rsquo;s cry;<br>
Or slow, like noontide ghost, would glide<br>
Along the dark-grey bulwarks&rsquo; side,<br>
And ever on the heaving tide<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Look down with weary eye.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;  65<br>
Oft did the cliff, and swelling main,<br>
Recall the thoughts of Whitby&rsquo;s fane,--<br>
A home she ne&rsquo;er might see again;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For she had laid adown,<br>
So Douglas bade, the hood and veil,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  70<br>
And frontlet of the cloister pale,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Benedictine gown:<br>
It were unseemly sight, he said,<br>
A novice out of convent shade.-<br>
Now her bright locks, with sunny glow,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 75<br>
Again adorn&rsquo;d her brow of snow;<br>
Her mantle rich, whose borders, round,<br>
A deep and fretted broidery bound,<br>
In golden foldings sought the ground;<br>
Of holy ornament, alone&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;  80<br>
Remain&rsquo;d a cross with ruby stone;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And often did she look<br>
On that which in her hand she bore,<br>
With velvet bound, and broider&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her breviary book.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 85<br>
In such a place, so lone, so grim,<br>
At dawning pale, or twilight dim,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It fearful would have been<br>
To meet a form so richly dress&rsquo;d,<br>
With book in hand, and cross on breast,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  90<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And such a woeful mien.<br>
Fitz-Eustace, loitering with his bow,<br>
To practise on the gull and crow,<br>
Saw her, at distance, gliding slow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And did by Mary swear,-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; 95<br>
Some love-lorn Fay she might have been,<br>
Or, in Romance, some spell-bound Queen;<br>
For ne&rsquo;er, in work-day world, was seen<br>
A form so witching fair.<br>
<br>
<br>
IV.<br>
<br>
Once walking thus, at evening tide,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 100<br>
It chanced a gliding sail she spied,<br>
And, sighing, thought-&lsquo;The Abbess, there,<br>
Perchance, does to her home repair;<br>
Her peaceful rule, where Duty, free,<br>
Walks hand in hand with Charity;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  105<br>
Where oft Devotion&rsquo;s tranced glow<br>
Can such a glimpse of heaven bestow,<br>
That the enraptured sisters see<br>
High vision, and deep mystery;<br>
The very form of Hilda fair,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  110<br>
Hovering upon the sunny air,<br>
And smiling on her votaries&rsquo; prayer.<br>
O! wherefore, to my duller eye,<br>
Did still the Saint her form deny!<br>
Was it, that, sear&rsquo;d by sinful scorn,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 115<br>
My heart could neither melt nor burn?<br>
Or lie my warm affections low,<br>
With him, that taught them first to glow?<br>
Yet, gentle Abbess, well I knew,<br>
To pay thy kindness grateful due,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 120<br>
And well could brook the mild command,<br>
That ruled thy simple maiden band.<br>
How different now! condemn&rsquo;d to bide<br>
My doom from this dark tyrant&rsquo;s pride.-<br>
But Marmion has to learn, ere long,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 125<br>
That constant mind, and hate of wrong,<br>
Descended to a feeble girl,<br>
From Red De Clare, stout Gloster&rsquo;s Earl:<br>
Of such a stem, a sapling weak,<br>
He ne&rsquo;er shall bend, although he break.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 130<br>
<br>
<br>
V.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;But see!-what makes this armour here?&rsquo;-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For in her path there lay<br>
Targe, corslet, helm;-she view&rsquo;d them near.-<br>
&lsquo;The breast-plate pierced!-Ay, much I fear,<br>
Weak fence wert thou &lsquo;gainst foeman&rsquo;s spear,&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  135<br>
That hath made fatal entrance here,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As these dark blood-gouts say.-<br>
Thus Wilton!-Oh! not corslet&rsquo;s ward,<br>
Not truth, as diamond pure and hard,<br>
Could be thy manly bosom&rsquo;s guard,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 140<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On yon disastrous day!&rsquo;-<br>
She raised her eyes in mournful mood,-<br>
WILTON himself before her stood!<br>
It might have seem&rsquo;d his passing ghost,<br>
For every youthful grace was lost;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  145<br>
And joy unwonted, and surprise,<br>
Gave their strange wildness to his eyes.-<br>
Expect not, noble dames and lords,<br>
That I can tell such scene in words:<br>
What skilful limner e&rsquo;er would choose&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 150<br>
To paint the rainbow&rsquo;s varying hues,<br>
Unless to mortal it were given<br>
To dip his brush in dyes of heaven?<br>
Far less can my weak line declare<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Each changing passion&rsquo;s shade;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 155<br>
Brightening to rapture from despair,<br>
Sorrow, surprise, and pity there,<br>
And joy, with her angelic air,<br>
And hope, that paints the future fair,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their varying hues display&rsquo;d:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; 160<br>
Each o&rsquo;er its rival&rsquo;s ground extending,<br>
Alternate conquering, shifting, blending,<br>
Till all, fatigued, the conflict yield,<br>
And mighty Love retains the field,<br>
Shortly I tell what then he said,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 165<br>
By many a tender word delay&rsquo;d,<br>
And modest blush, and bursting sigh,<br>
And question kind, and fond reply:-<br>
<br>
<br>
VI.<br>
<br>
De Wilton&rsquo;s History.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Forget we that disastrous day,<br>
When senseless in the lists I lay.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  170<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thence dragg&rsquo;d,-but how I cannot know,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For sense and recollection fled,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I found me on a pallet low,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within my ancient beadsman&rsquo;s shed.<br>
Austin,-remember&rsquo;st thou, my Clare,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  175<br>
How thou didst blush, when the old man,<br>
When first our infant love began,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Said we would make a matchless pair?-<br>
Menials, and friends, and kinsmen fled<br>
From the degraded traitor&rsquo;s bed,-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  180<br>
He only held my burning head,<br>
And tended me for many a day,<br>
While wounds and fever held their sway.<br>
But far more needful was his care,<br>
When sense return&rsquo;d to wake despair;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  185<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For I did tear the closing wound,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And dash me frantic on the ground,<br>
If e&rsquo;er I heard the name of Clare.<br>
At length, to calmer reason brought,<br>
Much by his kind attendance wrought,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  190<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With him I left my native strand,<br>
And, in a Palmer&rsquo;s weeds array&rsquo;d<br>
My hated name and form to shade,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I journey&rsquo;d many a land;<br>
No more a lord of rank and birth,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 195<br>
But mingled with the dregs of earth.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oft Austin for my reason fear&rsquo;d,<br>
When I would sit, and deeply brood<br>
On dark revenge, and deeds of blood,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or wild mad schemes uprear&rsquo;d.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; 200<br>
My friend at length fell sick, and said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;God would remove him soon:<br>
And, while upon his dying bed,<br>
He begg&rsquo;d of me a boon-<br>
If e&rsquo;er my deadliest enemy&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 205<br>
Beneath my brand should conquer&rsquo;d lie,<br>
Even then my mercy should awake,<br>
And spare his life for Austin&rsquo;s sake.<br>
<br>
<br>
VII.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Still restless as a second Cain,<br>
To Scotland next my route was ta&rsquo;en,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  210<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Full well the paths I knew.<br>
Fame of my fate made various sound,<br>
That death in pilgrimage I found,<br>
That I had perish&rsquo;d of my wound,-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;None cared which tale was true:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 215<br>
And living eye could never guess<br>
De Wilton in his Palmer&rsquo;s dress;<br>
For now that sable slough is shed,<br>
And trimm&rsquo;d my shaggy beard and head,<br>
I scarcely know me in the glass.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  220<br>
A chance most wondrous did provide,<br>
That I should be that Baron&rsquo;s guide-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not name his name!-<br>
Vengeance to God alone belongs;<br>
But, when I think on all my wrongs,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 225<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My blood is liquid flame!<br>
And ne&rsquo;er the time shall I forget,<br>
When in a Scottish hostel set,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dark looks we did exchange:<br>
What were his thoughts I cannot tell;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 230<br>
But in my bosom muster&rsquo;d Hell<br>
Its plans of dark revenge.<br>
<br>
<br>
VIII.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;A word of vulgar augury,<br>
That broke from me, I scarce knew why,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought on a village tale;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 235<br>
Which wrought upon his moody sprite,<br>
And sent him armed forth by night.<br>
I borrow&rsquo;d steed and mail,<br>
And weapons, from his sleeping band;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And, passing from a postern door,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 240<br>
We met, and &lsquo;counter&rsquo;d, hand to hand,-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He fell on Gifford-moor.<br>
For the death-stroke my brand I drew,<br>
(O then my helmed head he knew,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Palmer&rsquo;s cowl was gone,)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 245<br>
Then had three inches of my blade<br>
The heavy debt of vengeance paid,-<br>
My hand the thought of Austin staid;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I left him there alone.-<br>
O good old man! even from the grave,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  250<br>
Thy spirit could thy master save:<br>
If I had slain my foeman, ne&rsquo;er<br>
Had Whitby&rsquo;s Abbess, in her fear,<br>
Given to my hand this packet dear,<br>
Of power to clear my injured fame,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  255<br>
And vindicate De Wilton&rsquo;s name.-<br>
Perchance you heard the Abbess tell<br>
Of the strange pageantry of Hell,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That broke our secret speech-<br>
It rose from the infernal shade,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  260<br>
Or featly was some juggle play&rsquo;d,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A tale of peace to teach.<br>
Appeal to Heaven I judged was best,<br>
When my name came among the rest.<br>
<br>
<br>
IX.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Now here, within Tantallon Hold,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 265<br>
To Douglas late my tale I told,<br>
To whom my house was known of old.<br>
Won by my proofs, his falchion bright<br>
This eve anew shall dub me knight.<br>
These were the arms that once did turn&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  270<br>
The tide of fight on Otterburne,<br>
And Harry Hotspur forced to yield,<br>
When the Dead Douglas won the field.<br>
These Angus gave-his armourer&rsquo;s care,<br>
Ere morn, shall every breach repair;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  275<br>
For nought, he said, was in his halls,<br>
But ancient armour on the walls,<br>
And aged chargers in the stalls,<br>
And women, priests, and grey-hair&rsquo;d men;<br>
The rest were all in Twisel glen.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 280<br>
And now I watch my armour here,<br>
By law of arms, till midnight&rsquo;s near;<br>
Then, once again a belted knight,<br>
Seek Surrey&rsquo;s camp with dawn of light.<br>
<br>
<br>
X.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;There soon again we meet, my Clare!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  285<br>
This Baron means to guide thee there:<br>
Douglas reveres his King&rsquo;s command,<br>
Else would he take thee from his band.<br>
And there thy kinsman, Surrey, too,<br>
Will give De Wilton justice due.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  290<br>
Now meeter far for martial broil,<br>
Firmer my limbs, and strung by toil,<br>
Once more&rsquo;-&lsquo;O Wilton! must we then<br>
Risk new-found happiness again,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Trust fate of arms once more?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
295<br>
And is there not an humble glen,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where we, content and poor,<br>
Might build a cottage in the shade,<br>
A shepherd thou, and I to aid<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy task on dale and moor?-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  300<br>
That reddening brow!-too well I know,<br>
Not even thy Clare can peace bestow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;While falsehood stains thy name:<br>
Go then to fight!&nbsp; Clare bids thee go!<br>
Clare can a warrior&rsquo;s feelings know,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  305<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And weep a warrior&rsquo;s shame;<br>
Can Red Earl Gilbert&rsquo;s spirit feel,<br>
Buckle the spurs upon thy heel,<br>
And belt thee with thy brand of steel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And send thee forth to fame!&rsquo;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; 310<br>
<br>
<br>
XI.<br>
<br>
That night, upon the rocks and bay,<br>
The midnight moon-beam slumbering lay,<br>
And pour&rsquo;d its silver light, and pure,<br>
Through loop-hole, and through embrazure,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon Tantallon tower and hall;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  315<br>
But chief where arched windows wide<br>
Illuminate the chapel&rsquo;s pride,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The sober glances fall.<br>
Much was there need; though seam&rsquo;d with scars,<br>
Two veterans of the Douglas&rsquo; wars,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  320<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though two grey priests were there,<br>
And each a blazing torch held high,<br>
You could not by their blaze descry<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The chapel&rsquo;s carving fair.<br>
Amid that dim and smoky light,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  325<br>
Chequering the silvery moon-shine bright,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A bishop by the altar stood,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A noble lord of Douglas blood,<br>
With mitre sheen, and rocquet white.<br>
Yet show&rsquo;d his meek and thoughtful eye&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  330<br>
But little pride of prelacy;<br>
More pleased that, in a barbarous age,<br>
He gave rude Scotland Virgil&rsquo;s page,<br>
Than that beneath his rule he held<br>
The bishopric of fair Dunkeld.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  335<br>
Beside him ancient Angus stood,<br>
Doff&rsquo;d his furr&rsquo;d gown, and sable hood:<br>
O&rsquo;er his huge form and visage pale,<br>
He wore a cap and shirt of mail;<br>
And lean&rsquo;d his large and wrinkled hand&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  340<br>
Upon the huge and sweeping brand<br>
Which wont of yore, in battle fray,<br>
His foeman&rsquo;s limbs to shred away,<br>
As wood-knife lops the sapling spray.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He seem&rsquo;d as, from the tombs around&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 345<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rising at judgment-day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some giant Douglas may be found<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all his old array;<br>
So pale his face, so huge his limb,<br>
So old his arms, his look so grim.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  350<br>
<br>
<br>
XII.<br>
<br>
Then at the altar Wilton kneels,<br>
And Clare the spurs bound on his heels;<br>
And think what next he must have felt,<br>
At buckling of the falchion belt!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And judge how Clara changed her hue,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  355<br>
While fastening to her lover&rsquo;s side<br>
A friend, which, though in danger tried,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He once had found untrue!<br>
Then Douglas struck him with his blade:<br>
&lsquo;Saint Michael and Saint Andrew aid,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  360<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I dub thee knight.<br>
Arise, Sir Ralph, De Wilton&rsquo;s heir!<br>
For King, for Church, for Lady fair,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;See that thou fight.&rsquo;-<br>
And Bishop Gawain, as he rose,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  365<br>
Said-&lsquo;Wilton! grieve not for thy woes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Disgrace, and trouble;<br>
For He, who honour best bestows,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;May give thee double.&rsquo;-<br>
De Wilton sobb&rsquo;d, for sob he must-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 370<br>
&lsquo;Where&rsquo;er I meet a Douglas, trust<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That Douglas is my brother!&rsquo;<br>
&lsquo;Nay, nay,&rsquo; old Angus said, &lsquo;not so;<br>
To Surrey&rsquo;s camp thou now must go,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy wrongs no longer smother.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
375<br>
I have two sons in yonder field;<br>
And, if thou meet&rsquo;st them under shield,<br>
Upon them bravely-do thy worst;<br>
And foul fall him that blenches first!&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
XIII.<br>
<br>
Not far advanced was morning day,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 380<br>
When Marmion did his troop array<br>
To Surrey&rsquo;s camp to ride;<br>
He had safe-conduct for his band,<br>
Beneath the royal seal and hand,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Douglas gave a guide:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; 385<br>
The ancient Earl, with stately grace,<br>
Would Clara on her palfrey place,<br>
And whisper&rsquo;d in an under tone,<br>
&lsquo;Let the hawk stoop, his prey is flown.&rsquo;-<br>
The train from out the castle drew,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 390<br>
But Marmion stopp&rsquo;d to bid adieu:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Though something I might plain,&rsquo; he said,<br>
&lsquo;Of cold respect to stranger guest,<br>
Sent hither by your King&rsquo;s behest,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;While in Tantallon&rsquo;s towers I staid;&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  395<br>
Part we in friendship from your land,<br>
And, noble Earl, receive my hand.&rsquo;-<br>
But Douglas round him drew his cloak,<br>
Folded his arms, and thus he spoke:-<br>
&lsquo;My manors, halls, and bowers, shall still&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  400<br>
Be open, at my Sovereign&rsquo;s will,<br>
To each one whom he lists, howe&rsquo;er<br>
Unmeet to be the owner&rsquo;s peer.<br>
My castles are my King&rsquo;s alone,<br>
From turret to foundation-stone-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 405<br>
The hand of Douglas is his own;<br>
And never shall in friendly grasp<br>
The hand of such as Marmion clasp.&rsquo;-<br>
<br>
<br>
XIV.<br>
<br>
Burn&rsquo;d Marmion&rsquo;s swarthy cheek like fire,<br>
And shook his very frame for ire,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 410<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And-&lsquo;This to me!&rsquo; he said,<br>
&lsquo;An &lsquo;twere not for thy hoary beard,<br>
Such hand as Marmion&rsquo;s had not spared<br>
&lsquo;To cleave the Douglas&rsquo; head!<br>
And, first, I tell thee, haughty Peer,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  415<br>
He, who does England&rsquo;s message here,<br>
Although the meanest in her state,<br>
May well, proud Angus, be thy mate:<br>
And, Douglas, more I tell thee here,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in thy pitch of pride,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
420<br>
Here in thy hold, thy vassals near,<br>
(Nay, never look upon your lord,<br>
And lay your hands upon your sword,)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I tell thee, thou&rsquo;rt defied!<br>
And if thou said&rsquo;st, I am not peer&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  425<br>
To any lord in Scotland here,<br>
Lowland or Highland, far or near,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Angus, thou hast lied!&rsquo;-<br>
On the Earl&rsquo;s cheek the flush of rage<br>
O&rsquo;ercame the ashen hue of age:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  430<br>
Fierce he broke forth,-&lsquo;And darest thou then<br>
To beard the lion in his den,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Douglas in his hall?<br>
And hopest thou hence unscathed to go?-<br>
No, by Saint Bride of Bothwell, no!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 435<br>
Up drawbridge, grooms-what, Warder, ho!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the portcullis fall.&rsquo;-<br>
Lord Marmion turn&rsquo;d,-well was his need,<br>
And dash&rsquo;d the rowels in his steed,<br>
Like arrow through the archway sprung,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  440<br>
The ponderous grate behind him rung:<br>
To pass there was such scanty room,<br>
The bars, descending, razed his plume.<br>
<br>
<br>
XV.<br>
<br>
The steed along the drawbridge flies,<br>
Just as it trembled on the rise;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  445<br>
Nor lighter does the swallow skim<br>
Along the smooth lake&rsquo;s level brim:<br>
And when Lord Marmion reach&rsquo;d his band,<br>
He halts, and turns with clenched hand,<br>
And shout of loud defiance pours,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 450<br>
And shook his gauntlet at the towers.<br>
&lsquo;Horse! horse!&rsquo; the Douglas cried, &lsquo;and chase!&rsquo;<br>
But soon he rein&rsquo;d his fury&rsquo;s pace:<br>
&lsquo;A royal messenger he came,<br>
Though most unworthy of the name.-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 455<br>
A letter forged! Saint Jude to speed!<br>
Did ever knight so foul a deed!<br>
At first in heart it liked me ill,<br>
When the King praised his clerkly skill.<br>
Thanks to Saint Bothan, son of mine,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  460<br>
Save Gawain, ne&rsquo;er could pen a line:<br>
So swore I, and I swear it still,<br>
Let my boy-bishop fret his fill.-<br>
Saint Mary mend my fiery mood!<br>
Old age ne&rsquo;er cools the Douglas blood,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  465<br>
I thought to slay him where he stood.<br>
&lsquo;Tis pity of him too,&rsquo; he cried;<br>
&lsquo;Bold can he speak, and fairly ride,<br>
I warrant him a warrior tried.&rsquo;<br>
With this his mandate he recalls,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 470<br>
And slowly seeks his castle halls.<br>
<br>
<br>
XVI.<br>
<br>
The day in Marmion&rsquo;s journey wore;<br>
Yet, e&rsquo;er his passion&rsquo;s gust was o&rsquo;er,<br>
They cross&rsquo;d the heights of Stanrig-moor.<br>
His troop more closely there he scann&rsquo;d,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  475<br>
And miss&rsquo;d the Palmer from the band.-<br>
&lsquo;Palmer or not,&rsquo; young Blount did say,<br>
&lsquo; He parted at the peep of day;<br>
Good sooth, it was in strange array.&rsquo;-<br>
&lsquo;In what array?&rsquo; said Marmion, quick.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 480<br>
&lsquo;My Lord, I ill can spell the trick;<br>
But all night long, with clink and bang,<br>
Close to my couch did hammers clang;<br>
At dawn the falling drawbridge rang,<br>
And from a loop-hole while I peep,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  485<br>
Old Bell-the-Cat came from the Keep,<br>
Wrapp&rsquo;d in a gown of sables fair,<br>
As fearful of the morning air;<br>
Beneath, when that was blown aside,<br>
A rusty shirt of mail I spied,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  490<br>
By Archibald won in bloody work,<br>
Against the Saracen and Turk:<br>
Last night it hung not in the hall;<br>
I thought some marvel would befall.<br>
And next I saw them saddled lead&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  495<br>
Old Cheviot forth, the Earl&rsquo;s best steed;<br>
A matchless horse, though something old,<br>
Prompt to his paces, cool and bold.<br>
I heard the Sheriff Sholto say,<br>
The Earl did much the Master pray&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 500<br>
To use him on the battle-day;<br>
But he preferr&rsquo;d&rsquo;-&rsquo;Nay, Henry, cease!<br>
Thou sworn horse-courser, hold thy peace.-<br>
Eustace, thou bear&rsquo;st a brain-I pray,<br>
What did Blount see at break of day?&rsquo;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 505<br>
<br>
<br>
XVII.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;In brief, my lord, we both descried<br>
(For then I stood by Henry&rsquo;s side)<br>
The Palmer mount, and outwards ride,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the Earl&rsquo;s own favourite steed:<br>
All sheathed he was in armour bright,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 510<br>
And much resembled that same knight,<br>
Subdued by you in Cotswold fight:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Angus wish&rsquo;d him speed.&rsquo;-<br>
The instant that Fitz-Eustace spoke,<br>
A sudden light on Marmion broke;-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  515<br>
&lsquo;Ah! dastard fool, to reason lost!&rsquo;<br>
He mutter&rsquo;d; &lsquo;Twas nor fay nor ghost<br>
I met upon the moonlight wold,<br>
But living man of earthly mould.-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O dotage blind and gross!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; 520<br>
Had I but fought as wont, one thrust<br>
Had laid De Wilton in the dust,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My path no more to cross.-<br>
How stand we now?-he told his tale<br>
To Douglas; and with some avail;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  525<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Twas therefore gloom&rsquo;d his rugged brow.-<br>
Will Surrey dare to entertain,<br>
&lsquo;Gainst Marmion, charge disproved and vain?<br>
Small risk of that, I trow.<br>
Yet Clare&rsquo;s sharp questions must I shun;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  330<br>
Must separate Constance from the Nun-<br>
O, what a tangled web we weave,<br>
When first we practise to deceive!<br>
A Palmer too!-no wonder why<br>
I felt rebuked beneath his eye:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 535<br>
I might have known there was but one,<br>
Whose look could quell Lord Marmion.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
XVIII.<br>
<br>
Stung with these thoughts, he urged to speed<br>
His troop, and reach&rsquo;d, at eve, the Tweed,<br>
Where Lennel&rsquo;s convent closed their march;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  540<br>
(There now is left but one frail arch,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet mourn thou not its cells;<br>
Our time a fair exchange has made;<br>
Hard by, in hospitable shade,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A reverend pilgrim dwells,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 545<br>
Well worth the whole Bernardine brood,<br>
That e&rsquo;er wore sandal, frock, or hood.)<br>
Yet did Saint Bernard&rsquo;s Abbot there<br>
Give Marmion entertainment fair,<br>
And lodging for his train and Clare.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  550<br>
Next morn the Baron climb&rsquo;d the tower,<br>
To view afar the Scottish power,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Encamp&rsquo;d on Flodden edge:<br>
The white pavilions made a show,<br>
Like remnants of the winter snow,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 555<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the dusky ridge.<br>
Long Marmion look&rsquo;d:-at length his eye<br>
Unusual movement might descry<br>
Amid the shifting lines:<br>
The Scottish host drawn out appears,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  560<br>
For, flashing on the hedge of spears,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The eastern sunbeam shines.<br>
Their front now deepening, now extending;<br>
Their flank inclining, wheeling, bending,<br>
Now drawing back, and now descending,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 565<br>
The skilful Marmion well could know,<br>
They watch&rsquo;d the motions of some foe,<br>
Who traversed on the plain below.<br>
<br>
<br>
XIX.<br>
<br>
Even so it was.&nbsp; From Flodden ridge<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Scots beheld the English host&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 570<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave Barmore-wood, their evening post,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And heedful watch&rsquo;d them as they cross&rsquo;d<br>
The Till by Twisel Bridge.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;High sight it is, and haughty, while<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They dive into the deep defile;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 575<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the cavern&rsquo;d cliff they fall,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the castle&rsquo;s airy wall.<br>
By rock, by oak, by hawthorn-tree,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Troop after troop are disappearing;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Troop after troop their banners rearing,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  580<br>
Upon the eastern bank you see.<br>
Still pouring down the rocky den,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where flows the sullen Till,<br>
And rising from the dim-wood glen,<br>
Standards on standards, men on men,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 585<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In slow succession still,<br>
And, sweeping o&rsquo;er the Gothic arch,<br>
And pressing on, in ceaseless march,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To gain the opposing hill.<br>
That morn, to many a trumpet clang,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 590<br>
Twisel! thy rock&rsquo;s deep echo rang;<br>
And many a chief of birth and rank,<br>
Saint Helen! at thy fountain drank.<br>
Thy hawthorn glade, which now we see<br>
In spring-tide bloom so lavishly,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 595<br>
Had then from many an axe its doom,<br>
To give the marching columns room.<br>
<br>
<br>
XX.<br>
<br>
And why stands Scotland idly now,<br>
Dark Flodden! on thy airy brow,<br>
Since England gains the pass the while,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 600<br>
And struggles through the deep defile?<br>
What checks the fiery soul of James?<br>
Why sits that champion of the dames<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Inactive on his steed,<br>
And sees, between him and his land,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 605<br>
Between him and Tweed&rsquo;s southern strand,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His host Lord Surrey lead?<br>
What &lsquo;vails the vain knight-errant&rsquo;s brand?--<br>
O, Douglas, for thy leading wand!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fierce Randolph, for thy speed!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 610<br>
O for one hour of Wallace wight,<br>
Or well-skill&rsquo;d Bruce, to rule the fight,<br>
And cry-&lsquo;Saint Andrew and our right!&rsquo;<br>
Another sight had seen that morn,<br>
From Fate&rsquo;s dark book a leaf been torn,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 615<br>
And Flodden had been Bannockbourne!-<br>
The precious hour has pass&rsquo;d in vain,<br>
And England&rsquo;s host has gain&rsquo;d the plain;<br>
Wheeling their march, and circling still,<br>
Around the base of Flodden hill.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  620<br>
<br>
<br>
XXI.<br>
<br>
Ere yet the bands met Marmion&rsquo;s eye,<br>
Fitz-Eustace shouted loud and high,<br>
&lsquo;Hark! hark! my lord, an English drum!<br>
And see ascending squadrons come<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Between Tweed&rsquo;s river and the hill,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 625<br>
Foot, horse, and cannon:-hap what hap,<br>
My basnet to a prentice cap,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Surrey&rsquo;s o&rsquo;er the Till!-<br>
Yet more! yet more!-how far array&rsquo;d<br>
They file from out the hawthorn shade,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  630<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And sweep so gallant by!<br>
With all their banners bravely spread,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And all their armour flashing high,<br>
Saint George might waken from the dead,<br>
To see fair England&rsquo;s standards fly.&rsquo;-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 635<br>
&lsquo;Stint in thy prate,&rsquo; quoth Blount, &lsquo;thou&rsquo;dst
best,<br>
And listen to our lord&rsquo;s behest.&rsquo;-<br>
With kindling brow Lord Marmion said,-<br>
&lsquo;This instant be our band array&rsquo;d;<br>
The river must be quickly cross&rsquo;d,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  640<br>
That we may join Lord Surrey&rsquo;s host.<br>
If fight King James,-as well I trust,<br>
That fight he will, and fight he must,-<br>
The Lady Clare behind our lines<br>
Shall tarry, while the battle joins.&rsquo;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 645<br>
<br>
<br>
XXII.<br>
<br>
Himself he swift on horseback threw,<br>
Scarce to the Abbot bade adieu;<br>
Far less would listen to his prayer,<br>
To leave behind the helpless Clare.<br>
Down to the Tweed his band he drew,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 650<br>
And mutter&rsquo;d as the flood they view,<br>
&lsquo;The pheasant in the falcon&rsquo;s claw,<br>
He scarce will yield to please a daw:<br>
Lord Angus may the Abbot awe,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So Clare shall bide with me.&rsquo;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; 655<br>
Then on that dangerous ford, and deep,<br>
Where to the Tweed Leat&rsquo;s eddies creep,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He ventured desperately:<br>
And not a moment will he bide,<br>
Till squire, or groom, before him ride;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 660<br>
Headmost of all he stems the tide,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And stems it gallantly.<br>
Eustace held Clare upon her horse,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Hubert led her rein,<br>
Stoutly they braved the current&rsquo;s course,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 665<br>
And, though far downward driven per force,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The southern bank they gain;<br>
Behind them, straggling, came to shore,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As best they might, the train:<br>
Each o&rsquo;er his head his yew-bow bore,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  670<br>
A caution not in vain;<br>
Deep need that day that every string,<br>
By wet unharm&rsquo;d, should sharply ring.<br>
A moment then Lord Marmion staid,<br>
And breathed his steed, his men array&rsquo;d,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  675<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then forward moved his band,<br>
Until, Lord Surrey&rsquo;s rear-guard won,<br>
He halted by a Cross of Stone,<br>
That, on a hillock standing lone,<br>
Did all the field command.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 680<br>
<br>
<br>
XXIII.<br>
<br>
Hence might they see the full array<br>
Of either host, for deadly fray;<br>
Their marshall&rsquo;d lines stretch&rsquo;d east and west,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And fronted north and south,<br>
And distant salutation pass&rsquo;d&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
685<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From the loud cannon mouth;<br>
Not in the close successive rattle,<br>
That breathes the voice of modern battle,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But slow and far between.-<br>
The hillock gain&rsquo;d, Lord Marmion staid:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 690<br>
&lsquo;Here, by this Cross,&rsquo; he gently said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;You well may view the scene.<br>
Here shalt thou tarry, lovely Clare:<br>
O! think of Marmion in thy prayer!-<br>
Thou wilt not?-well, no less my care&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 695<br>
Shall, watchful, for thy weal prepare.-<br>
You, Blount and Eustace, are her guard,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With ten pick&rsquo;d archers of my train;<br>
With England if the day go hard,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To Berwick speed amain.-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; 700<br>
But if we conquer, cruel maid,<br>
My spoils shall at your feet be laid,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When here we meet again.&rsquo;<br>
He waited not for answer there,<br>
And would not mark the maid&rsquo;s despair,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  705<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor heed the discontented look<br>
From either squire; but spurr&rsquo;d amain,<br>
And, dashing through the battle-plain,<br>
His way to Surrey took.<br>
<br>
<br>
XXIV.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;-The good Lord Marmion, by my life!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 710<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to danger&rsquo;s hour!-<br>
Short greeting serves in time of strife :<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus have I ranged my power:<br>
Myself will rule this central host,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Stout Stanley fronts their right,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 715<br>
My sons command the vaward post,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With Brian Tunstall, stainless knight;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Dacre, with his horsemen light,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall be in rear-ward of the fight,<br>
And succour those that need it most.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  720<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, gallant Marmion, well I know,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Would gladly to the vanguard go;<br>
Edmund, the Admiral, Tunstall there,<br>
With thee their charge will blithely share;<br>
There fight thine own retainers too,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  725<br>
Beneath De Burg, thy steward true.&rsquo;-<br>
&lsquo;Thanks, noble Surrey!&rsquo; Marmion said,<br>
Nor farther greeting there he paid;<br>
But, parting like a thunderbolt,<br>
First in the vanguard made a halt,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  730<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where such a shout there rose<br>
Of &lsquo;Marmion! Marmion!&rsquo; that the cry,<br>
Up Flodden mountain shrilling high,<br>
Startled the Scottish foes.<br>
<br>
<br>
XXV.<br>
<br>
Blount and Fitz-Eustace rested still&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  735<br>
With Lady Clare upon the hill;<br>
On which, (for far the day was spent,)<br>
The western sunbeams now were bent.<br>
The cry they heard, its meaning knew,<br>
Could plain their distant comrades view:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  740<br>
Sadly to Blount did Eustace say,<br>
&lsquo;Unworthy office here to stay!<br>
No hope of gilded spurs to-day.-<br>
But see! look up-on Flodden bent<br>
The Scottish foe has fired his tent.&rsquo;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 745<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And sudden, as he spoke,<br>
From the sharp ridges of the hill,<br>
All downward to the banks of Till,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was wreathed in sable smoke.<br>
Volumed and fast, and rolling far,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  750<br>
The cloud enveloped Scotland&rsquo;s war,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As down the hill they broke;<br>
Nor martial shout, nor minstrel tone,<br>
Announced their march; their tread alone,<br>
At times one warning trumpet blown,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 755<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At times a stifled hum,<br>
Told England, from his mountain-throne<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;King James did rushing come.-<br>
Scarce could they hear, or see their foes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Until at weapon-point they close.-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 760<br>
They close, in clouds of smoke and dust,<br>
With sword-sway, and with lance&rsquo;s thrust;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And such a yell was there,<br>
Of sudden and portentous birth,<br>
As if men fought upon the earth,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  765<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And fiends in upper air;<br>
Oh, life and death were in the shout,<br>
Recoil and rally, charge and rout,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And triumph and despair.<br>
Long look&rsquo;d the anxious squires; their eye&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  770<br>
Could in the darkness nought descry.<br>
<br>
<br>
XXVI.<br>
<br>
At length the freshening western blast<br>
Aside the shroud of battle cast;<br>
And, first, the ridge of mingled spears<br>
Above the brightening cloud appears;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  775<br>
And in the smoke the pennons flew,<br>
As in the storm the white sea-mew.<br>
Then mark&rsquo;d they, dashing broad and far,<br>
The broken billows of the war,<br>
And plumed crests of chieftains brave,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  780<br>
Floating like foam upon the wave;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But nought distinct they see:<br>
Wide raged the battle on the plain;<br>
Spears shook, and falchions flash&rsquo;d amain;<br>
Fell England&rsquo;s arrow-flight like rain;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  785<br>
Crests rose, and stoop&rsquo;d, and rose again,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Wild and disorderly.<br>
Amid the scene of tumult, high<br>
They saw Lord Marmion&rsquo;s falcon fly:<br>
And stainless Tunstall&rsquo;s banner white,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  790<br>
And Edmund Howard&rsquo;s lion bright,<br>
Still bear them bravely in the fight;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Although against them come,<br>
Of gallant Gordons many a one,<br>
And many a stubborn Badenoch-man,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 795<br>
And many a rugged Border clan,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With Huntly, and with Home.<br>
<br>
<br>
XXVII.<br>
<br>
Far on the left, unseen the while,<br>
Stanley broke Lennox and Argyle;<br>
Though there the western mountaineer&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  800<br>
Rush&rsquo;d with bare bosom on the spear,<br>
And flung the feeble targe aside,<br>
And with both hands the broadsword plied.<br>
&lsquo;Twas vain:-But Fortune, on the right,<br>
With fickle smile, cheer&rsquo;d Scotland&rsquo;s fight.&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  805<br>
Then fell that spotless banner white,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Howard&rsquo;s lion fell;<br>
Yet still Lord Marmion&rsquo;s falcon flew<br>
With wavering flight, while fiercer grew<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Around the battle-yell.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; 810<br>
The Border slogan rent the sky!<br>
A Home! a Gordon! was the cry:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Loud were the clanging blows;<br>
Advanced,-forced back,-now low, now high,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The pennon sunk and rose;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; 815<br>
As bends the bark&rsquo;s mast in the gale,<br>
When rent are rigging, shrouds, and sail,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It waver&rsquo;d &lsquo;mid the foes.<br>
No longer Blount the view could bear:<br>
&lsquo;By Heaven, and all its saints! I swear&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 820<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not see it lost!<br>
Fitz-Eustace, you with Lady Clare<br>
May bid your beads, and patter prayer,-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I gallop to the host.&rsquo;<br>
And to the fray he rode amain,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  825<br>
Follow&rsquo;d by all the archer train.<br>
The fiery youth, with desperate charge,<br>
Made, for a space, an opening large,-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The rescued banner rose,-<br>
But darkly closed the war around,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 830<br>
Like pine-tree rooted from the ground,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It sank among the foes.<br>
Then Eustace mounted too:-yet staid,<br>
As loath to leave the helpless maid,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When, fast as shaft can fly,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 835<br>
Blood-shot his eyes, his nostrils spread,<br>
The loose rein dangling from his head,<br>
Housing and saddle bloody red,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Marmion&rsquo;s steed rush&rsquo;d by;<br>
And Eustace, maddening at the sight,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  840<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A look and sign to Clara cast,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To mark he would return in haste,<br>
Then plunged into the fight.<br>
<br>
<br>
XXVIII.<br>
<br>
Ask me not what the maiden feels,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Left in that dreadful hour alone:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 845<br>
Perchance her reason stoops, or reels;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Perchance a courage, not her own,<br>
Braces her mind to desperate tone.-<br>
The scatter&rsquo;d van of England wheels;-<br>
She only said, as loud in air&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 850<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The tumult roar&rsquo;d, &lsquo;Is Wilton there?&rsquo;-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They fly, or, madden&rsquo;d by despair,<br>
Fight but to die,-&rsquo;Is Wilton there?&rsquo;-<br>
With that, straight up the hill there rode<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Two horsemen drench&rsquo;d with gore,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  855<br>
And in their arms, a helpless load,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A wounded knight they bore.<br>
His hand still strain&rsquo;d the broken brand;<br>
His arms were smear&rsquo;d with blood and sand:<br>
Dragg&rsquo;d from among the horses&rsquo; feet,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  860<br>
With dinted shield, and helmet beat,<br>
The falcon-crest and plumage gone,<br>
Can that be haughty Marmion! . . .<br>
Young Blount his armour did unlace,<br>
And gazing on his ghastly face,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 865<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Said-&rsquo;By Saint George, he&rsquo;s gone!<br>
That spear-wound has our master sped,<br>
And see the deep cut on his head!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Good-night to Marmion.&rsquo;-<br>
&lsquo;Unnurtured Blount! thy brawling cease:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 870<br>
He opes his eyes,&rsquo; said Eustace; &lsquo;peace!&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
XXIX.<br>
<br>
When, doff&rsquo;d his casque, he felt free air,<br>
Around &lsquo;gan Marmion wildly stare:-<br>
&lsquo;Where&rsquo;s Harry Blount?&nbsp; Fitz-Eustace where?<br>
Linger ye here, ye hearts of hare!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  875<br>
Redeem my pennon,-charge again!<br>
Cry&rdquo;Marmion to the rescue!&rdquo;-Vain!<br>
Last of my race, on battle-plain<br>
That shout shall ne&rsquo;er be heard again!-<br>
Yet my last thought is England&rsquo;s-fly,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  880<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To Dacre bear my signet-ring:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell him his squadrons up to bring.-<br>
Fitz-Eustace, to Lord Surrey hie;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tunstall lies dead upon the field,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His life-blood stains the spotless shield:&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  885<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Edmund is down;-my life is reft;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Admiral alone is left.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Let Stanley charge with spur of fire,-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With Chester charge, and Lancashire,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Full upon Scotland&rsquo;s central host,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  890<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or victory and England&rsquo;s lost.-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Must I bid twice?-hence, varlets! fly!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave Marmion here alone-to die.&rsquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They parted, and alone he lay;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Clare drew her from the sight away,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 895<br>
Till pain wrung forth a lowly moan,<br>
And half he murmur&rsquo;d,-&lsquo;Is there none,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all my halls have nurst,<br>
Page, squire, or groom, one cup to bring<br>
Of blessed water from the spring,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 900<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To slake my dying thirst!&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
XXX.<br>
<br>
O, Woman! in our hours of ease,<br>
Uncertain, coy, and hard to please,<br>
And variable as the shade<br>
By the light quivering aspen made;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  905<br>
When pain and anguish wring the brow,<br>
A ministering angel thou!-<br>
Scarce were the piteous accents said,<br>
When, with the Baron&rsquo;s casque, the maid<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To the nigh streamlet ran:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 910<br>
Forgot were hatred, wrongs, and fears;<br>
The plaintive voice alone she hears,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sees but the dying man.<br>
She stoop&rsquo;d her by the runnel&rsquo;s side,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But in abhorrence backward drew;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  915<br>
For, oozing from the mountain&rsquo;s side,<br>
Where raged the war, a dark-red tide<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was curdling in the streamlet blue.<br>
Where shall she turn!-behold her mark<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A little fountain cell,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; 920<br>
Where water, clear as diamond-spark,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In a stone basin fell.<br>
Above, some half-worn letters say,<br>
Drink . weary . pilgrim . drink . and . pray .<br>
&nbsp;for . the . kind . soul . of . Sybil .Grey .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 925<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who . built . this . cross . and . well .<br>
She fill&rsquo;d the helm, and back she hied,<br>
And with surprise and joy espied<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A Monk supporting Marmion&rsquo;s head;<br>
A pious man, whom duty brought&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  930<br>
To dubious verge of battle fought,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To shrieve the dying, bless the dead.<br>
<br>
<br>
XXXI.<br>
<br>
Deep drank Lord Marmion of the wave,<br>
And, as she stoop&rsquo;d his brow to lave-<br>
&lsquo;Is it the hand of Clare,&rsquo; he said,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 935<br>
&lsquo;Or injured Constance, bathes my head?&rsquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, as remembrance rose,-<br>
&lsquo;Speak not to me of shrift or prayer!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I must redress her woes.<br>
Short space, few words, are mine to spare&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 940<br>
Forgive and listen, gentle Clare!&rsquo;-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Alas!&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;the while,-<br>
O, think of your immortal weal!<br>
In vain for Constance is your zeal;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She-died at Holy Isle.&rsquo;-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;  945<br>
Lord Marmion started from the ground,<br>
As light as if he felt no wound;<br>
Though in the action burst the tide,<br>
In torrents, from his wounded side.<br>
&lsquo;Then it was truth,&rsquo;-he said-&rsquo;I knew&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  950<br>
That the dark presage must be true.-<br>
I would the Fiend, to whom belongs<br>
The vengeance due to all her wrongs,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Would spare me but a day!<br>
For wasting fire, and dying groan,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  955<br>
And priests slain on the altar stone,<br>
Might bribe him for delay.<br>
It may not be!-this dizzy trance-<br>
Curse on yon base marauder&rsquo;s lance,<br>
And doubly cursed my failing brand!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 960<br>
A sinful heart makes feeble hand.&rsquo;<br>
Then, fainting, down on earth he sunk,<br>
Supported by the trembling Monk.<br>
<br>
<br>
XXXII.<br>
<br>
With fruitless labour, Clara bound,<br>
And strove to stanch the gushing wound:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 965<br>
The Monk, with unavailing cares,<br>
Exhausted all the Church&rsquo;s prayers.<br>
Ever, he said, that, close and near,<br>
A lady&rsquo;s voice was in his ear,<br>
And that the priest he could not hear;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  970<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For that she ever sung,<br>
<i>&lsquo;In the lost battle, borne down by the flying,<br>
Where mingles war&rsquo;s rattle with groans of the dying</i>!&rsquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So the notes rung;-<br>
&lsquo;Avoid thee, Fiend!-with cruel hand,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 975<br>
Shake not the dying sinner&rsquo;s sand!-<br>
O, look, my son, upon yon sign<br>
Of the Redeemer&rsquo;s grace divine;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O, think on faith and bliss!<br>
By many a death-bed I have been,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  980<br>
And many a sinner&rsquo;s parting seen,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But never aught like this.&rsquo;-<br>
The war, that for a space did fail,<br>
Now trebly thundering swell&rsquo;d the gale,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And-STANLEY! was the cry;-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  985<br>
A light on Marmion&rsquo;s visage spread,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And fired his glazing eye:<br>
With dying hand, above his head,<br>
He shook the fragment of his blade,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And shouted &lsquo;Victory!-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 990<br>
Charge, Chester, charge!&nbsp; On, Stanley, on!&rsquo;<br>
Were the last words of Marmion.<br>
<br>
<br>
XXXIII.<br>
<br>
By this, though deep the evening fell,<br>
Still rose the battle&rsquo;s deadly swell,<br>
For still the Scots, around their King,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 995<br>
Unbroken, fought in desperate ring.<br>
Where&rsquo;s now their victor vaward wing,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Huntly, and where Home?-<br>
O, for a blast of that dread horn,<br>
On Fontarabian echoes borne,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1000<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That to King Charles did come,<br>
When Rowland brave, and Olivier,<br>
And every paladin and peer,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On Roncesvalles died!<br>
Such blasts might warn them, not in vain,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  1005<br>
To quit the plunder of the slain,<br>
And turn the doubtful day again,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;While yet on Flodden side,<br>
Afar, the Royal Standard flies,<br>
And round it toils, and bleeds, and dies,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  1010<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Caledonian pride!<br>
In vain the wish-for far away,<br>
While spoil and havoc mark their way,<br>
Near Sybil&rsquo;s Cross the plunderers stray.-<br>
&lsquo;O Lady,&rsquo; cried the Monk, &lsquo;away!&rsquo;&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 1015<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And placed her on her steed,<br>
And led her to the chapel fair,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Tilmouth upon Tweed.<br>
There all the night they spent in prayer,<br>
And at the dawn of morning, there&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  1020<br>
She met her kinsman, Lord Fitz-Clare.<br>
<br>
<br>
XXXIV.<br>
<br>
But as they left the dark&rsquo;ning heath,<br>
More desperate grew the strife of death,<br>
The English shafts in volleys hail&rsquo;d,<br>
In headlong charge their horse assail&rsquo;d;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1025<br>
Front, flank, and rear, the squadrons sweep<br>
To break the Scottish circle deep,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That fought around their King.<br>
But yet, though thick the shafts as snow,<br>
Though charging knights like whirlwinds go,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  1030<br>
Though bill-men ply the ghastly blow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Unbroken was the ring;<br>
The stubborn spear-men still made good<br>
Their dark impenetrable wood,<br>
Each stepping where his comrade stood,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1035<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The instant that he fell.<br>
No thought was there of dastard flight;<br>
Link&rsquo;d in the serried phalanx tight,<br>
Groom fought like noble, squire like knight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As fearlessly and well;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;  1040<br>
Till utter darkness closed her wing<br>
O&rsquo;er their thin host and wounded King.<br>
Then skilful Surrey&rsquo;s sage commands<br>
Led back from strife his shatter&rsquo;d bands;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And from the charge they drew,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1045<br>
As mountain-waves, from wasted lands,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweep back to ocean blue.<br>
Then did their loss his foemen know;<br>
Their King, their Lords, their mightiest low,<br>
They melted from the field, as snow,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1050<br>
When streams are swoln and south winds blow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dissolves in silent dew.<br>
Tweed&rsquo;s echoes heard the ceaseless plash,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;While many a broken band,<br>
Disorder&rsquo;d, through her currents dash,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1055<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To gain the Scottish land;<br>
To town and tower, to down and dale,<br>
To tell red Flodden&rsquo;s dismal tale,<br>
And raise the universal wail.<br>
Tradition, legend, tune, and song,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1060<br>
Shall many an age that wail prolong:<br>
Still from the sire the son shall hear<br>
Of the stern strife, and carnage drear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Flodden&rsquo;s fatal field,<br>
Where shiver&rsquo;d was fair Scotland&rsquo;s spear,<br>
And broken was her shield!<br>
<br>
<br>
XXXV.<br>
<br>
Day dawns upon the mountain&rsquo;s side:-<br>
There, Scotland! lay thy bravest pride,<br>
Chiefs, knights, and nobles, many a one:<br>
The sad survivors all are gone.--&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  1072<br>
View not that corpse mistrustfully,<br>
Defaced and mangled though it be;<br>
Nor to yon Border castle high,<br>
Look northward with upbraiding eye;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor cherish hope in vain,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 1075<br>
That, journeying far on foreign strand,<br>
The Royal Pilgrim to his land<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;May yet return again.<br>
He saw the wreck his rashness wrought;<br>
Reckless of life, he desperate fought,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1080<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And fell on Flodden plain:<br>
And well in death his trusty brand,<br>
Firm clench&rsquo;d within his manly hand,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Beseem&rsquo;d the monarch slain.<br>
But, O! how changed since yon blithe night!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  1085<br>
Gladly I turn me from the sight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto my tale again.<br>
<br>
<br>
XXXVI.<br>
<br>
Short is my tale:-Fitz-Eustace&rsquo; care<br>
A pierced and mangled body bare<br>
To moated Lichfield&rsquo;s lofty pile;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  1090<br>
And there, beneath the southern aisle,<br>
A tomb, with Gothic sculpture fair,<br>
Did long Lord Marmion&rsquo;s image bear,<br>
(Now vainly for its site you look;<br>
&lsquo;Twas levell&rsquo;d, when fanatic Brook&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1095<br>
The fair cathedral storm&rsquo;d and took;<br>
But, thanks to Heaven, and good Saint Chad,<br>
A guerdon meet the spoiler had!)<br>
There erst was martial Marmion found,<br>
His feet upon a couchant hound,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  1100<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His hands to Heaven upraised;<br>
And all around, on scutcheon rich,<br>
And tablet carved, and fretted niche,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His arms and feats were blazed.<br>
And yet, though all was carved so fair,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  1105<br>
And priest for Marmion breathed the prayer,<br>
The last Lord Marmion lay not there.<br>
From Ettrick woods, a peasant swain<br>
Follow&rsquo;d his lord to Flodden plain,-<br>
One of those flowers, whom plaintive lay&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1110<br>
In Scotland mourns as &lsquo;wede away&rsquo;:<br>
Sore wounded, Sybil&rsquo;s Cross he spied,<br>
And dragg&rsquo;d him to its foot, and died,<br>
Close by the noble Marmion&rsquo;s side.<br>
The spoilers stripp&rsquo;d and gash&rsquo;d the slain,&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  1115<br>
And thus their corpses were mista&rsquo;en;<br>
And thus, in the proud Baron&rsquo;s tomb,<br>
The lowly woodsman took the room.<br>
<br>
<br>
XXXVII.<br>
<br>
Less easy task it were, to show<br>
Lord Marmion&rsquo;s nameless grave, and low.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  1120<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They dug his grave e&rsquo;en where he lay,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But every mark is gone;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Time&rsquo;s wasting hand has done away<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The simple Cross of Sybil Grey,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And broke her font of stone:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
1123<br>
But yet from out the little hill<br>
Oozes the slender springlet still,<br>
Oft halts the stranger there,<br>
For thence may best his curious eye<br>
The memorable field descry;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  1130<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And shepherd boys repair<br>
To seek the water-flag and rush,<br>
And rest them by the hazel bush,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And plait their garlands fair;<br>
Nor dream they sit upon the grave,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1135<br>
That holds the bones of Marmion brave.-<br>
When thou shalt find the little hill,<br>
With thy heart commune, and be still.<br>
If ever, in temptation strong,<br>
Thou left&rsquo;st the right path for the wrong;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1140<br>
If every devious step, thus trod,<br>
Still led thee farther from the road;<br>
Dread thou to speak presumptuous doom<br>
On noble Marmion&rsquo;s lowly tomb;<br>
But say, &lsquo;He died a gallant knight,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  1145<br>
With sword in hand, for England&rsquo;s right.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
XXXVIII.<br>
<br>
I do not rhyme to that dull elf,<br>
Who cannot image to himself,<br>
That all through Flodden&rsquo;s dismal night,<br>
Wilton was foremost in the fight;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  1150<br>
That, when brave Surrey&rsquo;s steed was slain,<br>
&lsquo;Twas Wilton mounted him again;<br>
&lsquo;Twas Wilton&rsquo;s brand that deepest hew&rsquo;d,<br>
Amid the spearmen&rsquo;s stubborn wood:<br>
Unnamed by Hollinshed or Hall,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1155<br>
He was the living soul of all;<br>
That, after fight, his faith made plain,<br>
He won his rank and lands again;<br>
And charged his old paternal shield<br>
With bearings won on Flodden Field.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  1160<br>
Nor sing I to that simple maid,<br>
To whom it must in terms be said,<br>
That King and kinsmen did agree,<br>
To bless fair Clara&rsquo;s constancy;<br>
Who cannot, unless I relate,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1165<br>
Paint to her mind the bridal&rsquo;s state;<br>
That Wolsey&rsquo;s voice the blessing spoke,<br>
More, Sands, and Denny, pass&rsquo;d the joke:<br>
That bluff King Hal the curtain drew,<br>
And Catherine&rsquo;s hand the stocking threw;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1170<br>
And afterwards, for many a day,<br>
That it was held enough to say,<br>
In blessing to a wedded pair,<br>
&lsquo;Love they like Wilton and like Clare!&rsquo;<br>

Why then a final note prolong,<br>

<b>NOTES<br>
<br>
by<br>
<br>
Thomas Bayne<br>
INTRODUCTION TO CANTO FIRST.<br>
</b>With regard to the Introductions generally, Lockhart writes, in
Life of Scott, ii. 150:-&lsquo;Though the author himself does not allude
to, and had perhaps forgotten the circumstance, when writing the Introductory
Essay of 1830-they were announced, by an advertisement early in 1807,
as &ldquo;Six Epistles from Ettrick Forest,&rdquo; to be published in
a separate volume, similar to that of the Ballads and Lyrical Pieces;
and perhaps it might have been better that this first plan had been
adhered to. But however that may be, are there any pages, among all
he ever wrote, that one would be more sorry he should not have written?
They are among the most delicious portraitures that genius ever painted
of itself-buoyant, virtuous, happy genius-exulting in its own energies,
yet possessed and mastered by a clear, calm, modest mind, and happy
only in diffusing happiness around it.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;With what gratification those Epistles were read by the friends
to whom they were addressed it is superfluous to show. He had, in fact,
painted them almost as fully as himself; and who might not have been
proud to find a place in such a gallery? The tastes and habits of six
of those men, in whose intercourse Scott found the greatest pleasure
when his fame was approaching its meridian splendour, are thus preserved
for posterity; and when I reflect with what avidity we catch at the
least hint which seems to afford us a glimpse of the intimate circle
of any great poet of former ages, I cannot but believe that posterity
would have held this record precious, even had the individuals been
in themselves far less remarkable than a Rose, an Ellis, a Heber, a
Skene, a Marriott, and an Erskine.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
William Stewart Rose (1775-1843), to whom Scott addresses the Introduction
to Canto First, was a well-known man of letters in his time. He addressed
to Hallam, in 1819, a work in two vols., entitled &lsquo;Letters from
the North of Italy,&rsquo; and escaped a prohibitory order from the
Emperor of Austria by ingeniously changing his title to &lsquo;A Treatise
upon Sour Krout,&rsquo; &amp;c. His other original works are, &lsquo;Apology
addressed to the Travellers&rsquo; Club; or, Anecdotes of Monkeys&rsquo;;
&lsquo;Thoughts and Recollections by one of the Last Century&rsquo;;
and &lsquo;Epistle to the Hon. J. Hookham Frere in Malta.&rsquo; His
translations are these:-&lsquo;Amadis of Gaul: a Poem in three Books,
freely translated from the French version of Nicholas de Herberay&rsquo;
(1803); &lsquo;Partenopex de Blois, a Romance in four Cantos, from the
French of M. Le Grand&rsquo; (1807); &lsquo;Court and Parliament of
Beasts, translated from the Animali Parlanti of Giambatista Casti&rsquo;
(1819); and &lsquo;Orlando Furioso, translated into English Verse&rsquo;
(1825-1831). The closing lines of this Introduction refer to Rose&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Amadis&rsquo; and &lsquo;Partenopex.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
Ashestiel, whence the Introduction to the First Canto is dated, is on
the Tweed, about six miles above Abbotsford. &lsquo;The valley there
is narrow,&rsquo; says Lockhart, &lsquo;and the aspect in every direction
is that of perfect pastoral repose.&rsquo; This was Scott&rsquo;s home
from 1804 to l812, when he removed to Abbotsford.<br>
<br>
--------------------<br>
<br>
<b>lines 1-52.</b> This notable winter piece is the best modern contribution
to that series of poetical descriptions by Scottish writers which includes
Dunbar&rsquo;s &lsquo;Meditatioun in Winter,&rsquo; Gavin Douglas&rsquo;s
Scottish winter scene in the Prologue to his Virgil&rsquo;s Aeneid VII,
Hamilton of Bangour&rsquo;s Ode III, and, of course, Thomson&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Winter&rsquo; in &lsquo;The Seasons.&rsquo; The details of the
piece are given with admirable skill, and the local place-names are
used with characteristic effect. The note of regret over winter&rsquo;s
ravages, common to all early Scottish poets, is skilfully struck and
preserved, and thus the contrast designed between the wintry landscape
and &lsquo;my Country&rsquo;s wintry state&rsquo; is rendered sharper
and more decisive.<br>
<br>
<b>line 3. steepy linn</b>. Steepy is Elizabethan = steep, precipitous.
Linn (Gael. <i>linne </i>= pool; A.S. <i>hlinna</i> = brook) is variously
used for &lsquo;pool under a waterfall,&rsquo; &lsquo;cascade,&rsquo;
&lsquo;precipice,&rsquo; and &lsquo;ravine.&rsquo; The reference here
is to the ravine close by Ashestiel, mentioned in Lockhart&rsquo;s description
of the surroundings:-&rsquo;On one side, close under the windows, is
a deep ravine clothed with venerable trees, down which a mountain rivulet
is heard, more than seen, in its progress to the Tweed.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<b>line 16</b>. <b>our forest hills</b>. Selkirkshire is poetically
called &lsquo;Ettrick Forest&rsquo;; hence the description of the soldiers
from that district killed at Flodden as &lsquo;the flowers of the forest.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<b>line 22</b>. Cp. Hamilton of Bangour&rsquo;s allusion (Ode III. 43)
to the appearance of winter on these heights;-<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Cast up thy eyes, how bleak and
bare<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wanders on the tops of Yare!&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<b>line 37</b>. <b>imps</b> (Gr. <i>emphutos</i>, Swed. <i>ympa</i>).
See &lsquo;Faery Queene,&rsquo; Book I. (Clarendon Press), note to Introd.
The word means (1) a graft; (2) a scion of a noble house; (3) a little
demon; (4) a mischievous child. The context implies that the last is
the sense in which the word is used here. Cp. Beattie&rsquo;s &lsquo;Minstrel,&rsquo;
i. 17:-<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Nor cared to mingle in the clamorous
fray<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of squabbling <i>imps</i>,&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<b>line 50</b>. <b>round</b>. Strictly speaking, a round is a circular
dance in which the performers hold each other by the hands. The term,
however, is fairly applicable to the frolicsome gambols of a group of
lambs in a spring meadow. Certain rounds became famous enough to be
individualised, as e.g. Sellenger&rsquo;s or St. Leger&rsquo;s round,
mentioned in the May-day song, &lsquo;Come Lasses and Lads.&rsquo; Cp.
Macbeth, iv. 1; Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream, ii. 2; and see note on
Comus, line 144, in &lsquo;English Poems of Milton,&rsquo; vol. i. (Clarendon
Press).<br>
<br>
<b>line 53</b>. Lockhart, in a foot-note to his edition of &lsquo;Marmion,&rsquo;
quotes from the &lsquo;Monthly Review&rsquo; of May, 1808: &lsquo;The
&ldquo;chance and change&rdquo; of nature-the vicissitudes which are
observable in the moral as well as the physical part of the creation-have
given occasion to more exquisite poetry than any other general subject....
The <i>Ai, ai, tai Malaki</i> of Moschus is worked up again to some
advantage in the following passage- &ldquo;To mute,&rdquo; &amp;c.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<b>lines 61, 62</b>. The inversion of reference in these lines is an
illustration of the rhetorical figure &lsquo;chiasmus.&rsquo; Cp. the
arrangement of the demonstrative pronouns in these sentences from &lsquo;Kenilworth&rsquo;:-&lsquo;Your
eyes contradict your tongue. That speaks of a protector, willing and
able to watch over you; but these tell me you are ruined.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<b>line 64</b>. Cp. closing lines of Wordsworth&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ode on
Intimations of Immortality&rsquo; (finished in 1806):-<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;To me the meanest flower that blows
can give<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thoughts that do often lie too deep
for tears.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<b>lines 65-8</b>. Nelson fell at Trafalgar, Oct. 21, 1805; Pitt died
Jan. 23, 1806.<br>
<br>
<b>line 72. Gadite wave.</b> The epithet is derived from <i>Gades</i>,
the Roman name of the modern Cadiz.<br>
<br>
<b>line 73</b>. <b>Levin</b> = lightning. See Canto I, line 400. Spenser
uses the phrase &lsquo;piercing levin&rsquo; in the July eclogue of
the &lsquo;Shepheards Calendar,&rsquo; and in &lsquo;Faery Queene,&rsquo;
III. v. 48. The word still occasionally occurs in poetry. Cp. Longfellow,
&lsquo;Golden Legend,&rsquo; v., near end:-<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;See! from its summit the lurid
levin<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flashes downward without warning!
&lsquo;<br>
<br>
<b>line 76</b>. <b>fated = </b>charged with determination of fate. Cp.
All&rsquo;s Well that Ends Well, i. I. 221-<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;The
fated sky<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gives us free scope.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<b>line 82. Hafnia</b>, is Copenhagen. The three victories are, the
battle of the Nile, 1798; the battle of the Baltic, 1801; and Trafalgar,
1805.<br>
<br>
<b>lines 84-86</b>. Pitt (1759-1806) became First Lord of the Treasury
and Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1783, and from 1785 onwards the facts
of his career are a constituent part of national history. He faced with
success difficulties like bread riots, mutinies in the fleet in 1797,
disturbances by the &lsquo;United Irishmen,&rsquo; and the alarming
threats of Napoleon. In 1800 the Union of Ireland with Great Britain
gave Irishmen new motives for living, and in 1803 national patriotism,
stirred and guided by Pitt, was manifested in the enrolment of over
three hundred thousand volunteers prepared to withstand the vaunted
&lsquo;Army of England.&rsquo; In spite of his distinguished position
and eminent services, Pitt died L40,000 in debt, and his responsibilities
were promptly met by a vote of the House of Commons.<br>
<br>
<b>lines 97-108</b>. These picturesque lines, with their varied and
suggestive metaphors, were interpolated on the blank page of the MS.
The reference in the expression &lsquo;tottering throne&rsquo; in line
104 is to the threatened insanity of George III.<br>
<br>
<b>lines 109-125</b>. Pitt&rsquo;s patriotism was consistent and thorough.
The anxious, troubled expression his face, betrayed in his latest appearances
in the House of Commons, Wilberforce spoke of as &lsquo;his Austerlitz
look,&rsquo; and there seems little doubt that the burden of his public
cares hastened his end. This gives point to the comparison of his fate
with that of Aeneas&rsquo;s pilot Palinurus (Aeneid v. 833).<br>
<br>
<b>lines 127-141</b>. Charles James Fox (1749-1806) was second son of
the first Lord Holland, whose indulgence tended to spoil a youth of
unusual ability and precocity. Extravagant habits, contracted at an
early age, were not easily thrown off afterwards, but they did not interfere
with Fox&rsquo;s efficiency as a statesman. His rivalry with Pitt dates
from 1783. Their tombs are near each other in Westminster Abbey.<br>
<br>
<b>line 146</b>. Cp. in Gray&rsquo;s &lsquo;Elegy&rsquo;:--<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Where through the long-drawn aisle
and fretted vault<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pealing anthem swells the note
of praise.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<b>line 153</b>. Jeffrey, in his criticism of &lsquo;Marmion&rsquo;
in the &lsquo;Edinburgh Review,&rsquo; found fault with the tribute
to Fox, and cavilled in particular at the expression &lsquo;Fox a Briton
died.&rsquo; He argued that Scott praised only the action of Fox in
breaking off the negotiations for peace with Napoleon, while insinuating
that the previous part of his career was unpatriotic. Only a special
pleader could put such an unworthy interpretation on the words.<br>
<br>
<b>lines 155-65</b>. By the result of the battle of Austerlitz (December,
1805) Napoleon seemed advancing towards general victory. Prussia hastily
patched up a dishonourable peace on terms inconsistent with very binding
pledges, and the Russian minister at Paris compromised his country by
yielding to humiliating proposals on the part of France. All this changed
Fox&rsquo;s view of the position, and he broke off the negotiations
for peace which had been begun in accordance with a policy he had long
advocated.<br>
<br>
<b>line 161</b>. There is a probable reference here to Nelson&rsquo;s
action at the battle of the Baltic. He disregarded the signal for cessation
of fighting given by Sir Hyde Parker, and ordered his own signal to
be nailed to the mast.<br>
<br>
<b>line 176</b>. Thessaly was noted for witchcraft. The scene of Virgil&rsquo;s
eighth Eclogue is laid in Thessaly as appropriate to the introduction
of such machinery as enchantments, love-spells, &amp;c. Cp. Horace,
Epode v. 21, and Ode I. xxvii. 21:-<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Quae saga, quis te solvere Thessalis<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magus venenis, quis poterit deus?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
In his &lsquo;Letters on Demonology and Witchcraft,&rsquo; Letter III.,
Scott, obviously basing his information on Horace, writes thus:-&lsquo;The
classic mythology presented numerous points in which it readily coalesced
with that of the Germans, Danes, and Northmen of a later period. They
recognised the power of Erictho, Canidia, and other sorceresses, whose
spells could perplex the course of the elements, intercept the influence
of the sun, and prevent his beneficial operation upon the fruits of
the earth; call down the moon from her appointed sphere, and disturb
the original and destined course of nature by their words and charms,
and the power of the evil spirits whom they evoked.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<b>line 181. Lees</b> is properly pl. of <i>lee</i> (Fr.<i>lie</i> =
dregs), the sediment or coarser parts of a liquid which settle at the
bottom, but it has come to be used as a collective word without reference
to a singular form. For phrase, cp. Macbeth, ii. 3. 96:-<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;The wine of life is drawn, and
the mere lees<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is left this vault to brag of.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<b>line 185</b>. Cp. Byron&rsquo;s &lsquo;Age of Bronze&rsquo;:-<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;But where are they-the rivals!-a
few feet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of sullen earth divide each winding-sheet.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<b>line 199. hearse</b>, from Old Fr. <i>herce</i> = harrow, portcullis.
In early English the word is used in the sense of &lsquo;harrow&rsquo;
and also of &lsquo;triangle,&rsquo; in reference to the shape of the
harrow. By-and-by it came to be used variously for &lsquo;bier,&rsquo;
&lsquo;funeral carriage,&rsquo; ornamental canopy with lighted candles
over the coffins of notable people during the funeral ceremony, the
permanent framework over a tomb, and even the tomb itself. Cp. Spenser&rsquo;s
Shep. Cal., November Eclogue:-<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Dido, my deare, alas! is dead,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead, and lyeth wrapt in lead.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O heavie herse!&rsquo;<br>
<br>
The gloss to this is, &lsquo;<i>Herse</i> is the solemne obsequie in
funeralles.&rsquo; Cp. also Ben Jonson&rsquo;s &lsquo;Epitaph on the
Countess of Pembroke&rsquo;:-<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Underneath this sable herse<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lies the subject of all verse.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<b>line 203</b>. The &lsquo;Border Minstrel&rsquo; is an appropriate
designation of the author of &lsquo;Contributions to the Minstrelsy
of the Scottish Border&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Lay of the Last Minstrel.&rsquo;
In the preface to the latter work, written in 1830, Scott refers to
the two great statesmen as having &lsquo;smiled on the adventurous minstrel.&rsquo;
This is the only existing evidence of Fox&rsquo;s appreciation. Pitt&rsquo;s
praise of the Lay his niece, Lady Hester Stanhope, reported to W. S.
Rose, who very naturally passed it on to Scott himself. The Right Hon.
William Dundas, in a letter to Scott, mentions a conversation he had
had with Pitt at his table, in 1805, and says that Pitt both expressed
his desire to advance Scott&rsquo;s professional interests and quoted
from the Lay the lines describing the embarrassment of the harper when
asked to play. &lsquo;This,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;is a sort of thing
which I might have expected in painting, but could never have fancied
capable of being given in poetry.&rsquo;-Lockhart&rsquo;s Life of Scott,
ii. 34.<br>
<br>
<b>line 204. Gothic</b>. This refers to both subject and style, neither
being classical.<br>
<br>
<b>line 220</b>. Lockhart quotes from Rogers&rsquo;s &lsquo;Pleasures
of Memory&rsquo;:-<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;If but a beam of sober reason play,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo! Fancy&rsquo;s fairy frostwork
melts away.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<b>lines 233-48</b>. In these lines the poet indicates the sphere in
which he had previously worked with independence and success. Like Virgil
when proceeding to write the AEneid, he is doubtful whether his devotion
to legendary and pastoral themes is sufficient warrant for attempting
heroic verse. The reference to the tales of shepherds in the closing
lines of the passage recalls the advice given (about 1880) to his students
by Prof. Shairp, when lecturing from the Poetry Chair at Oxford. &lsquo;To
become steeped,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;in the true atmosphere of romantic
poetry they should proceed to the Borders and learn their legends, under
the twofold guidance of Scott&rsquo;s &ldquo;Border Minstrelsy&rdquo;
and an intelligent local shepherd.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<b>line 256. steely weeds</b> = steel armour. &lsquo;Steely&rsquo; in
Elizabethan times was used both literally and figuratively. Shakespeare,
3 Henry VI. ii. 3. 16, has &lsquo;The steely point of Clifford&rsquo;s
lance,&rsquo; and Fisher in his &lsquo;Seuen Psalmes&rsquo; has &lsquo;tough
and <i>stely</i> hertes.&rsquo; For a modern literal example, see Crabbe&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Parish Register&rsquo;:-<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Steel through opposing plates the
magnet draws,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And <i>steely</i> atoms calls from
dust and straws.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<i>Weeds</i> in the sense of dress is confined, in modern English, to
widows&rsquo; robes. In Elizabethan times it had a general reference,
as e.g. Spenser&rsquo;s &lsquo;lowly Shephards weeds&rsquo; in the Introduction
to &lsquo;Faery Queene.&rsquo; Cp. below, Canto V. line 168, VI. line
192.<br>
<br>
<b>line 258</b>. The Champion is Launcelot, the most famous of King
Arthur&rsquo;s Knights of the Round Table. See Tennyson&rsquo;s &lsquo;Idylls
of the King,&rsquo; especially &lsquo;Lancelot and Elaine,&rsquo; and
William Morris&rsquo;s &lsquo;Defence of Guenevere.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<b>line 263</b>. Dame Ganore is Guenevere, Arthur&rsquo;s Queen.<br>
<br>
<b>lines 258-262</b>. Scott annotates these lines as follows:-<br>
<br>
&lsquo;The Romance of the Morte Arthur contains a sort of abridgment
of the most celebrated adventures of the Round Table; and, being written
in comparatively modern language, gives the general reader an excellent
idea of what romances of chivalry actually were. It has also the merit
of being written in pure old English; and many of the wild adventures
which it contains are told with a simplicity bordering upon the sublime.
Several of these are referred to in the text; and I would have illustrated
them by more full extracts, but as this curious work is about to be
republished, I confine myself to the tale of the Chapel Perilous, and
of the quest of Sir Launcelot after the Sangreal.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;&ldquo;Right so Sir Lanncelot departed, and when he came to the
Chapell Perilous, he alighted downe, and tied his horse to a little
gate. And as soon as he was within the churchyard, he saw, on the front
of the chapell, many faire rich shields turned upside downe; and many
of the shields Sir Launcelot had seene knights have before; with that
he saw stand by him thirtie great knights, more, by a yard, than any
man that ever he had seene, and all those grinned and gnashed at Sir
Launcelot; and when he saw their countenance, hee dread them sore, and
so put his shield afore him, and tooke his sword in his hand ready to
doe battaile; and they were all armed in black harneis, ready, with
their shields and swords drawen. And when Sir Launcelot would have gone
through them, they scattered on every side of him, and gave him the
way; and therewith he waxed all bold, and entered into the chapell,
and then hee saw no light but a dimme lampe burning, and then was he
ware of a corps covered with a cloath of silke; then Sir Launcelot stooped
downe, and cut a piece of that cloath away, and then it fared under
him as the earth had quaked a little, whereof he was afeard, and then
hee saw a faire sword lye by the dead knight, and that he gat in his
hand, and hied him out of the chappell. As soon as he was in the chappell-yerd,
all the knights spoke to him with a grimly voice, and said, &lsquo;Knight,
Sir Launcelot, lay that sword from thee, or else thou shalt die.&rsquo;-&rsquo;Whether
I live or die,&rsquo; said Sir Launcelot, &lsquo;with no great words
get yee it againe, therefore fight for it and ye list.&rsquo; Therewith
he passed through them; and beyond the chappell-yerd, there met him
a faire damosell, and said, &lsquo;Sir Launcelot, leave that sword behind
thee, or thou wilt die for it.&rsquo;-&rsquo;I will not leave it,&rsquo;
said Sir Launcelot, &lsquo;for no threats.&rsquo;-&rsquo;No?&rsquo;
said she; &lsquo;and ye did leave that sword, Queen Guenever should
ye never see.&rsquo;-&lsquo;Then were I a foole and I would leave this
sword,&rsquo; said Sir Launcelot. &lsquo;Now, gentle knight,&rsquo;
said the damosell, &lsquo;I require thee to kisse me once.&rsquo;-&rsquo;Nay,&rsquo;
said Sir Launcelot, &lsquo;that God forbid!&rsquo;-&lsquo;Well, sir,&rsquo;
said she, &lsquo;and thou hadest kissed me thy life dayes had been done;
but now, alas!&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;I have lost all my labour; for
I ordeined this chappell for thy sake, and for Sir Gawaine: and once
I had Sir Gawaine within it; and at that time he fought with that knight
which there lieth dead in yonder chappell, Sir Gilbert the bastard,
and at that time hee smote off Sir Gilbert the bastard&rsquo;s left
hand. And so, Sir Launcelot, now I tell thee, that I have loved thee
this seaven yeare; but there may no woman have thy love but Queene Guenever;
but sithen I may not rejoyice thee to have thy body alive, I had kept
no more joy in this world but to have had thy dead body; and I would
have balmed it and served, and so have kept it in my life daies, and
daily I should have clipped thee, and kissed thee, in the despite of
Queen Guenever.&rsquo;-&rsquo;Yee say well,&rsquo; said Sir Launcelot;
&lsquo;Jesus preserve me from your subtill craft.&rdquo; And therewith
he took his horse, and departed from her.&rdquo;&lsquo;<br>
<br>
Sir Thomas Malory&rsquo;s &lsquo;Morte D&rsquo;Arthure&rsquo; was first
printed by Caxton in 4to., 1485. A new issue of this belongs to 1634.
The republication referred to by Scott is probably the edition published
in 1816, in two vols. l8mo. The Roxburghe Club made a sumptuous reprint
in 1819, and Thomas Wright, in 1858, edited the work in three handy
8vo. vols. from the text of 1634. This edition is furnished with a very
useful introduction and notes.<br>
<br>
<b>lines 267-70</b>. &lsquo;One day when Arthur was holding a high feast
with his Knights of the Round Table, the Sangreal, or vessel out of
which the last passover was eaten, (a precious relic, which had long
remained concealed from human eyes, because of the sins of the land,)
suddenly appeared to him and all his chivalry. The consequence of this
vision was, that all the knights took on them a solemn vow to seek the
Sangreal. But, alas! it could only be revealed to a knight at once accomplished
in earthly chivalry, and pure and guiltless of evil conversation. All
Sir Launcelot&rsquo;s noble accomplishments were therefore rendered
vain by his guilty intrigue with Queen Guenever, or Ganore; and in this
holy quest he encountered only such disgraceful disasters as that which
follows:-<br>
<br>
&lsquo;But Sir Launcelot rode overthwart and endlong in a wild forest,
and held no path, but as wild adventure led him; and at the last, he
came unto a stone crosse, which departed two wayes, in wast land; and,
by the crosse, was a stone that was of marble; but it was so dark, that
Sir Launcelot might not well know what it was. Then Sir Launcelot looked
by him, and saw an old chappell, and there he wend to have found people.
And so Sir Launcelot tied his horse to a tree, and there he put off
his shield, and hung it upon a tree, and then hee went unto the chappell
doore, and found it wasted and broken. And within he found a faire altar,
full richly arrayed with cloth of silk, and there stood a faire candlestick,
which beare six great candles, and the candlesticke was of silver. And
when Sir Launcelot saw this light, hee had a great will for to enter
into the chappell, but he could find no place where hee might enter.
Then was he passing heavie and dismaied. Then he returned, and came
again to his horse, and tooke off his saddle and his bridle, and let
him pasture, and unlaced his helme, and ungirded his sword, and laid
him downe to sleepe upon his shield, before the crosse.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;And so hee fell on sleepe; and, halfe waking and halfe sleeping,
hee saw come by him two palfreys, both faire and white, the which beare
a litter, therein lying a sicke knight. And when he was nigh the crosse,
he there abode still. All this Sir Launcelot saw and beheld, for hee
slept not verily, and hee heard him say, &ldquo;O sweete Lord, when
shall this sorrow leave me, and when shall the holy vessell come by
me, where through I shall be blessed, for I have endured thus long for
little trespasse!&rdquo; And thus a great while complained the knight,
and allwaies Sir Launcelot heard it. With that Sir Launcelot saw the
candlesticke, with the fire tapers, come before the crosse; but he could
see no body that brought it. Also there came a table of silver, and
the holy vessel of the Sancgreall, the which Sir Launcelot had seen
before that time in King Petchour&rsquo;s house. And therewithall the
sicke knight set him upright, and held up both his hands, and said,
&ldquo;Faire sweete Lord, which is here within the holy vessell, take
heed to mee, that I may bee hole of this great malady!&rdquo; And therewith
upon his hands, and upon his knees, he went so nigh, that he touched
the holy vessell, and kissed it: And anon he was hole, and then he said,
&ldquo;Lord God, I thank thee, for I am healed of this malady.&rdquo;
Soo when the holy vessell had been there a great while, it went into
the chappell againe, with the candlesticke and the light, so that Sir
Launcelot wist not where it became, for he was overtaken with sinne,
that he had no power to arise against the holy vessell, wherefore afterward
many men said of him shame. But he tooke repentance afterward. Then
the sicke knight dressed him upright, and kissed the crosse. Then anon
his squire brought him his armes, and asked his lord how he did. &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo;
said hee, I thanke God right heartily, for through the holy vessell
I am healed: But I have right great mervaile of this sleeping knight,
which hath had neither grace nor power to awake during the time that
this holy vessell hath beene here present.&rdquo;-&ldquo;I dare it right
well say,&rdquo; said the squire, &ldquo;that this same knight is defouled
with some manner of deadly sinne, whereof he has never confessed.&rdquo;-&rdquo;By
my faith,&rdquo; said the knight, &ldquo;whatsoeer he be, he is unhappie;
for, as I deeme, hee is of the fellowship of the Round Table, the which
is entered into the quest of the Sancgreall.&rdquo;-&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo;
said the squire, &ldquo;here I have brought you all your armes, save
your helme and your sword; and, therefore, by mine assent, now may ye
take this knight&rsquo;s helme and his sword;&rsquo; and so he did.
And when he was cleane armed, he took Sir Launcelot&rsquo;s horse, for
he was better than his owne, and so they departed from the crosse.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Then anon Sir Launcelot awaked, and set himselfe upright, and
he thought him what hee had there seene, and whether it were dreames
or not; right so he heard a voice that said, &ldquo;Sir Launcelot, more
hardy than is the stone, and more bitter than is the wood, and more
naked and bare than is the liefe of the fig-tree, therefore go thou
from hence, and withdraw thee from this holy place;&rdquo; and when
Sir Launcelot heard this, he was passing heavy, and wist not what to
doe. And so he departed sore weeping, and cursed the time that he was
borne; for then he deemed never to have had more worship; for the words
went unto his heart, till that he knew wherefore that hee was so called.&rsquo;-SCOTT.<br>
<br>
<b>line 273</b>. Arthur is the hero of the &lsquo;Faery Queene.&rsquo;
In his explanatory letter to Sir Walter Raleigh, Spenser says, &lsquo;I
chose the historye of King Arthure, as most fitte for the excellency
of his person, being made famous by many mens former workes, and also
furthest from the daunger of envy, and suspicion of present time.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<b>line 274</b>. Milton is said to have meditated in his youth the composition
of an epic poem on Arthur and the Round Table. In &lsquo;Paradise Lost&rsquo;
ix. 26, he states that the subject of that poem pleased him &lsquo;long
choosing and beginning late,&rsquo; and references both in &lsquo;Paradise
Lost&rsquo; and &lsquo;Paradise Regained&rsquo; prove his familiarity
with the Arthurian legend. Cp. Par. Lost, i. 580, and Par. Reg. ii.
358.<br>
<br>
<b>line 275</b>. Scott quotes from Dryden&rsquo;s &lsquo;Essay on Satire,&rsquo;
prefixed to the translation of Juvenal, regarding his projected Epic.
&lsquo;Of two subjects,&rsquo; says Dryden, &lsquo;I was doubtful whether
I should choose that of King Arthur conquering the Saxons, which, being
further distant in time, gives the greater scope to my invention; or
that of Edward the Black Prince, in subduing Spain, and restoring it
to the lawful prince, though a great tyrant, Pedro the Cruel....I might
perhaps have done as well as some of my predecessors, or at least chalked
out a way for others to amend my errors in a like design; but being
encouraged only with fair words by King Charles II, my little salary
ill paid, and no prospect of a future subsistence, I was then discouraged
in the beginning of my attempt; and now age has overtaken me, and want,
a more insufferable evil, through the change of the times, has wholly
disabled me.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<b>lines 281-3</b>. Dryden&rsquo;s dramas, certain of his translations,
and various minor pieces adapted to the prevalent taste of his time,
are unworthy of his genius. Pope&rsquo;s reflections on the poet forgetful
of the dignity of his office, with the allusion to Dryden as an illustration
(&lsquo;Satires and Epistles,&rsquo; v. 209), may be compared with this
passage;-<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;I scarce can think him such a worthless
thing,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless he praise some monster of
a king;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or virtue, or religion turn to sport,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To please a lewd, or unbelieving
court.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unhappy Dryden! In all Charles&rsquo;s
days,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roscommon only boasts unspotted
bays.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<b>line 283</b>. Cp. Gray&rsquo;s &lsquo;Progress of Poesy,&rsquo; 103-<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Behold, where Dryden&rsquo;s less
presumptuous car<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wide o&rsquo;er the fields of glory
bear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two coursers of ethereal race,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With necks in thunder cloth&rsquo;d,

taught to join<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The varying verse, the full-resounding
line,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long majestic march, and energy
divine.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<b>line 286</b>. To break a lance is to enter the lists, to try one&rsquo;s
strength. The concussion of two powerful knights would suffice to shiver
the lances. Hence comes the figurative use. Cp. I Henry VI. iii. 2,-<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;What will you do, good greybeard?
break a lance,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And run a tilt at death within a
chair?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<b>lines 288-309</b>. The Genius of Chivalry is to be resuscitated from
the deep slumber under which baneful spells have long effectually held
him. The appropriateness of this is apparent when the true meaning of
Chivalry is considered. Scott opens his &lsquo;Essay on Chivalry&rsquo;
thus:-&rsquo;The primitive sense of this well-known word, derived from
the French <i>Chevalier</i>, signifies merely cavalry, or a body of
soldiers serving on horseback; and it has been used in that general
acceptation by the best of our poets, ancient and modern, from Milton
to Thomas Campbell.&rsquo; See Par. Lost, i. 307, and Battle of Hohenlinden.<br>
<br>
<b>line 294</b>. To spur forward his horse on an expedition of adventures,
like Spenser&rsquo;s Red Cross Knight. For the accoutrements and the
duties of a knight see Scott&rsquo;s &lsquo;Essay on Chivalry&rsquo;
(Miscellaneous Works, vol. vi.). Cp. &lsquo;Faery Queene,&rsquo; Book
I, and (especially for the personified abstractions from line 300 onwards)
Montgomerie&rsquo;s allegory, &lsquo;The Cherrie and the Slae.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<b>line 312</b>. Ytene&rsquo;s oaks. &lsquo;The New Forest in Hampshire,
anciently so called.&rsquo;-SCOTT. Gundimore, the residence of W. S.
Rose, was in this neighbourhood, and in an unpublished piece entitled
&lsquo;Gundimore,&rsquo; Rose thus alludes to a visit of Scott&rsquo;s:-<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Here Walter Scott has woo&rsquo;d
the northern muse;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here he with me has joy&rsquo;d

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hence has prick&rsquo;d through
Yten&rsquo;s holt, where we<br>

is abridged by my friend Mr. George Ellis, with that liveliness which
extracts amusement even out of the most rude and unpromising of our
old tales of chivalry. Ascapart, a most important personage in the romance,
is thus described in an extract:-<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;This geaunt was mighty and strong,<br>

<b>CANTO FIRST.<br>
</b>The Introduction is written on a basis of regular four-beat couplets,
each line being technically an iambic tetrameter; lines 96, 205, and
283 are Alexandrines, or iambic hexameters, each serving to give emphasis
and resonance (like the ninth of the Spenserian stanza) to the passage
which it closes.&nbsp; Intensity of expression is given by the triplet
which closes the passage ending with line 125. The metrical basis of
the movement in the Canto is likewise iambic tetrameter, but the trimeter
or three-beat line is freely introduced, and the poet allows himself
great scope in his arrangement.<br>
<br>
<b>Stanza I. line 1</b>. &lsquo;The ruinous castle of Norham (anciently
called Ubbanford) is situated on the southern bank of the Tweed, about
six miles above Berwick, and where that river is still the boundary
between England and Scotland. The extent of its ruins, as well as its
historical importance, shows it to have been a place of magnificence,
as well as strength. Edward I resided there when he was created umpire
of the dispute concerning the Scottish succession. It was repeatedly
taken and retaken during the wars between England and Scotland; and,
indeed, scarce any happened, in which it had not a principal share.
Norham Castle is situated on a steep bank, which overhangs the river.
The repeated sieges which the castle had sustained, rendered frequent
repairs necessary. In 1164, it was almost rebuilt by Hugh Pudsey, Bishop
of Durham, who added a huge keep, or donjon; notwithstanding which,
King Henry II, in 1174, took the castle from the bishop, and committed
the keeping of it to William de Neville. After this period it seems
to have been chiefly garrisoned by the King, and considered as a royal
fortress. The Greys of Chillinghame Castle were frequently the castellans,
or captains of the garrison: Yet, as the castle was situated in the
patrimony of St. Cuthbert, the property was in the see of Durham till
the Reformation. After that period, it passed through various hands.
At the union of the crowns, it was in the possession of Sir Robert Carey,
(afterwards Earl of Monmouth,) for his own life, and that of two of
his sons. After King James&rsquo;s accession, Carey sold Norham Castle
to George Home, Earl of Dunbar, for L6000. See his curious Memoirs,
published by Mr. Constable of Edinburgh.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;According to Mr. Pinkerton, there is, in the British Museum.
Cal. B. 6. 216, a curious memoir of the Dacres on the state of Norham
Castle in 1522, not long after the battle of Flodden. The inner ward,
or keep, is represented as impregnable:-&ldquo;The provisions are three
great vats of salt eels, forty-four kine, three hogsheads of salted
salmon, forty quarters of grain, besides many cows and four hundred
sheep, lying under the castle-wall nightly; but a number of the arrows
wanted feathers, and a good <i>Fletcher</i> [i.e. maker of arrows] was
required.&rdquo;-<i>History of Scotland</i>, vol. ii. p. 201, note.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;The ruins of the castle are at present considerable, as well
as picturesque. They consist of a large shattered tower, with many vaults,
and fragments of other edifices, enclosed within an outward wall of
great circuit.&rsquo;-SCOTT.<br>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>the donjon keep</b>. &lsquo;It is perhaps unnecessary
to remind my readers, that the <i>donjon</i>, in its proper signification,
means the strongest part of a feudal castle; a high square tower, with
walls of tremendous thickness, situated in the centre of the other buildings,
from which, however, it was usually detached. Here, in case of the outward
defences being gained, the garrison retreated to make their last stand.
The donjon contained the great hall, and principal rooms of state for
solemn occasions, and also the prison of the fortress; from which last
circumstance we derive the modern and restricted use of the word <i>dungeon</i>.
Ducange (<i>voce</i> DUNJO) conjectures plausibly, that the name is
derived from these keeps being usually built upon a hill, which in Celtic
is called DUN. Borlase supposes the word came from the darkness of the
apartments in these towers, which were thence figuratively called Dungeons;
thus deriving the ancient word from the modern application of it.&rsquo;-SCOTT.<br>

Scott annotates &lsquo;Milan steel&rsquo; and the legend thus:-<br>
<br>
&lsquo;The artists of Milan were famous in the middle ages for their
skill in armoury, as appears from the following passage, in which Froissart
gives an account of the preparations made by Henry, Earl of Hereford,
afterwards Henry IV, and Thomas, Duke of Norfolk, Earl Marischal, for
their proposed combat in the lists at Coventry:-&rdquo;These two lords
made ample provisions of all things necessary for the combat; and the
Earl of Derby sent off messengers to Lombardy, to have armour from Sir
Galeas, Duke of Milan. The Duke complied with joy, and gave the knight,
called Sir Francis, who had brought the message, the choice of all his
armour for the Earl of Derby. When he had selected what he wished for
in plated and mail armour, the Lord of Milan, out of his abundant love
for the Earl, ordered four of the best armourers in Milan to accompany
the knight to England, that the Earl of Derby might be more completely
armed.&rdquo;-JOHNES&rsquo; <i>Froissart</i>, vol. iv. p.597.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;The crest and motto of Marmion are borrowed from the following
story:-<br>
<br>
Sir David de Lindsay, first Earl of Cranford, was, among other gentlemen
of quality, attended, during a visit to London in 1390, by Sir William
Dalzell, who was, according to my authority, Bower, not only excelling
in wisdom, but also of a lively wit. Chancing to be at the Court, he
there saw Sir Piers Conrtenay, an English knight, famous for skill in
tilting, and for the beauty of his person, parading the palace, arrayed
in a new mantle, bearing for device an embroidered falcon, with this
rhyme,-<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I bear a falcon, fairest of night,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whoso pinches at her, his death
is dight1<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  2armour.<br>
-----------------------------------------------------<br>
&lsquo;The Scottish knight, being a wag, appeared next day in a dress
exactly similar to that of Courtenay, but bearing a magpie instead of
the falcon, with a motto ingeniously contrived to rhyme to the vaunting
inscription of Sir Piers:-<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I bear a pie picking at a piece,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whoso picks at her, I shall pick
at his nese3,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In

-----------------------------------------------------<br>
&lsquo;This affront could only be expiated by a just with sharp lances.
In the course, Dalzell left his helmet unlaced, so that it gave way
at the touch of his antagonist&rsquo;s lance, and he thus avoided the
shock of the encounter. This happened twice:-in the third encounter,
the handsome Courtenay lost two of his front teeth. As the Englishman
complained bitterly of Dalzell&rsquo;s fraud in not fastening his helmet,
the Scottishman agreed to run six courses more, each champion staking
in the hand of the King two hundred pounds, to be forfeited, if, on
entering the lists, any unequal advantage should be detected. This being
agreed to, the wily Scot demanded that Sir Piers, in addition to the
loss of his teeth, should consent to the extinction of one of his eyes,
he himself having lost an eye in the fight of Otterburn. As Courtenay
demurred to this equalisation of optical powers, Dalzell demanded the
forfeit; which, after much altercation, the King appointed to be paid
to him, saying, he surpassed the English both in wit and valour. This
must appear to the reader a singular specimen of the humour of that
time. I suspect the Jockey Club would have given a different decision
from Henry IV.&rsquo;<br>

<b>line 156</b>. &lsquo;Lord Marmion, the principal character of the

indeed, the family of Marmion, Lords of Fontenay, in Normandy, was highly
distinguished.&nbsp; Robert de Marmion, Lord of Fontenay, a distinguished
follower of the Conqueror, obtained a grant of the castle and town of
Tamworth, and also of the manor of Scrivelby, in Lincolnshire. One,
or both, of these noble possessions was held by the honourable service
of being the royal champion, as the ancestors of Marmion had formerly
been to the Dukes of Normandy. But after the castle and demesne of Tamworth
had passed through four successive barons from Robert, the family became
extinct in the person of Philip de Marmion, who died in 20th Edward
I without issue male.&nbsp; He was succeeded in his castle of Tamworth
by Alexander de Freville, who married Mazera, his grand-daughter. Baldwin
de Freville, Alexander&rsquo;s descendant, in the reign of Richard I,
by the supposed tenure of his castle of Tamworth, claimed the office
of royal champion, and to do the service appertaining; namely, on the
day of coronation, to ride, completely armed, upon a barbed horse, into
Westminster Hall, and there to challenge the combat against any who
would gainsay the King&rsquo;s title. But this office was adjudged to
Sir John Dymoke, to whom the manor of Scrivelby had descended by another
of the co-heiresses of Robert de Marmion; and it remains in that family,
whose representative is Hereditary Champion of England at the present
day. The family and possessions of Freville have merged in the Earls
of Ferrars. I have not, therefore, created a new family, but only revived
the titles of an old one in an imaginary personage.&rsquo;-SCOTT.<br>

a prisoner in Scotland, being surrendered by Henry VIII, on account
of his share in the slaughter of Sir Robert Ker of Cessford. His wife,

Ford Castle is about a mile to the north-east of Flodden Hill. It was
repaired in 1761 in accordance with the style of the original architecture.
Latterly the owner, the Countess of Waterford, utilizing the natural

exhibiting not only exquisite taste but a true philanthropic spirit.

who said it used &lsquo;to be sung at the merry-makings.&rsquo; He likewise
gave it a place in the &lsquo;Border Minstrelsy.&rsquo; These things
being so, it is unpleasant to learn from Lockhart that &lsquo;the ballad
here quoted was the production of Mr. R. Surtees, and palmed off by
him upon Scott as a genuine relic of antiquity. &lsquo;The title of

&lsquo;The story of Perkin Warbeck, or Richard, Duke of York, is well
known. In 1496, he was received honourably in Scotland; and James IV,
after conferring upon him in marriage his own relation, the Lady Catharine
Gordon, made war on England in behalf of his pretensions.&nbsp; To retaliate
an invasion of England, Surrey advanced into Berwickshire at the head
of considerable forces, but retreated, after taking the inconsiderable
fortress of Ayton. Ford, in his Dramatic Chronicle of Perkin Warbeck,
makes the most of this inroad:-<br>

<br>
<b>Stanza XIX. line 305</b>. &lsquo;The garrisons of the English castles
of Wark, Norham, and Berwick were, as may be easily supposed, very troublesome
neighbours to Scotland. Sir Richard Maitland of Ledington wrote a poem,
called &ldquo;The Blind Baron&rsquo;s Comfort,&rdquo; when his barony
of Blythe, in Lauderdale, was <i>harried</i> by Rowland Foster, the
English captain of Wark, with his company, to the number of 300 men.
They spoiled the poetical knight of 5000 sheep, 200 nolt, 30 horses
and mares; the whole furniture of his house of Blythe, worth 100 pounds
Scots (L8. 6s. 8d.), and every thing else that was portable. &ldquo;This
spoil was committed the 16th day of May, 1570, (and the said Sir Richard
was threescore and fourteen years of age, and grown blind,) in time
of peace; when nane of that country <i>lippened </i>[expected] such
a thing.&rdquo;-&rdquo;The Blind Baron&rsquo;s Comfort&rdquo; consists
in a string of puns on the word <i>Blythe</i>, the name of the lands
thus despoiled. Like John Littlewit, he had &ldquo;a conceit left him
in his misery-a miserable conceit.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;The last line of the text contains a phrase, by which the Borderers
jocularly intimated the burning a house. When the Maxwells, in 1685,
burned the castle of Lochwood, they said they did so to give the Lady
Johnstone &ldquo;light to set her hood.&rdquo; Nor was the phrase inapplicable;
for, in a letter, to which I have mislaid the reference, the Earl of
Northumberland writes to the King and Council, that he dressed himself
at midnight, at Warkworth, by the blaze of the neighbouring villages
burned by the Scottish marauders.&rsquo;-SCOTT.<br>

<b>line 342</b>. Scott here refers to Holinshed&rsquo;s account of Welsh,
the vicar of St. Thomas of Exeter, a leader among the Cornish insurgents
in 1549:-<br>
<br>
&lsquo;&ldquo;This man,&rdquo; says Holinshed, &ldquo;had many good
things in him. He was of no great stature, but well set, and mightilie
compact. He was a very good wrestler; shot well, both in the long-bow,
and also in the cross-bow; he handled his hand-gun and peece very well;
he was a very good woodman, and a hardie, and such a one as would not
give his head for the polling, or his beard for the washing. He was
a companion in any exercise of activitie, and of a courteous and gentle
behaviour. He descended of a good honest parentage, being borne at Peneverin,
in Cornwall; and yet, in this rebellion, an arch-captain, and a principal
doer.&rdquo;-Vol. iv. p. 958, 4to edition. This model of clerical talents
had the misfortune to be hanged upon the steeple of his own church.&rsquo;-SCOTT.<br>

<br>
&lsquo;Sante Rosalie was of Palermo, and born of a very noble family,
and, when very young, abhorred so much the vanities of this world, and
avoided the converse of mankind, resolving to dedicate herself wholly
to God Almighty, that she, by divine inspiration, forsook her father&rsquo;s
house, and never was more heard of, till her body was found in that
cleft of a rock, on that almost inaccessible mountain, where now the
chapel is built; and they affirm she was carried up there by the hands
of angels; for that place was not formerly so accessible (as now it
is) in the days of the Saint; and even now it is a very bad, and steepy,
and break-neck way. In this frightful place, this holy woman lived a
great many years, feeding only on what she found growing on that barren
mountain, and creeping into a narrow and dreadful cleft in a rock, which
was always dropping wet, and was her place of retirement, as well as
prayer; having worn out even the rock with her knees, in a certain place,
which is now open&rsquo;d on purpose to show it to those who come here.
This chapel is very richly adorn&rsquo;d; and on the spot where the
saint&rsquo;s dead body was discover&rsquo;d, which is just beneath
the hole in the rock, which is open&rsquo;d on purpose, as I said, there
is a very fine statue of marble, representing her in a lying posture,
railed in all about with fine iron and brass work; and the altar, on
which they say mass, is built just over it.&rsquo;-<i>Voyage to Sicily

in which the monk suggests to Gargantua that in order to induce sleep
they might together try the repetition of the seven penitential psalms.
&lsquo;The conceit pleased Gargantua very well; and, beginning the first

<b>line 453. ave</b>, an address to the Virgin Mary, beginning &lsquo;Ave

It has been objected to this line that the creed is not an essential
part of the rosary, and that ten aves and one paternoster would have
been more accurate. It should, however, be noticed that both Friar John
and young Selby know more of other matters than the details of religious
devotion.<br>
<br>
<b>Stanza XXVII. line 459</b>. &lsquo;A <i>Palmer</i>, opposed to a
<i>Pilgrim</i>, was one who made it his sole business to visit different
holy shrines; travelling incessantly, and subsisting by charity: whereas
the Pilgrim retired to his usual home and occupations, when he had paid
his devotions at the particular spot which was the object of his pilgrimage.
The Palmers seem to have been the <i>Quaestionarii</i> of the ancient
Scottish canons 1242 and 1296. There is in the Bannatyne MS. a burlesque
account of two such persons, entitled, &ldquo;Simmy and his Brother.&rdquo;
Their accoutrements are thus ludicrously described (I discard the ancient
spelling):-<br>

examples in Sir Erasmus Wilson&rsquo;s little work, &lsquo;Healthy Skin.&rsquo;
Many of the cases are within the writer&rsquo;s own knowledge, and all
the others are historical or otherwise well authenticated. He mentions
Sir T. More the night before his execution; two cases reported by Borellus;
three by Daniel Turner; one by Dr. Cassan; and in a note he recalls
John Libeny, a would-be assassin of the Emperor of Austria, &lsquo;whose
hair turned snow-white in the forty-eight hours preceding his execution.&rsquo;
See &lsquo;Notes and Queries,&rsquo; 6th S. vols. vi. to ix., and 7th

very suddenly. Byron makes his Prisoner of Chillon say that his white

<b>Stanza XXIX. line 506</b>. &lsquo;St. Regulus (<i>Scottice</i>, St.
Rule), a monk of Patrae, in Achaia, warned by a vision, is said, A.
D. 370, to have sailed westward, until he landed at St. Andrews, in
Scotland, where he founded a chapel and tower. The latter is still standing;
and, though we may doubt the precise date of its foundation, is certainly
one of the most ancient edifices in Scotland. A cave, nearly fronting
the ruinous castle of the Archbishops of St. Andrews, bears the name
of this religion person. It is difficult of access; and the rock in
which it is hewed is washed by the German Ocean. It is nearly round,
about ten feet in diameter, and the same in height. On one side is a
sort of stone altar; on the other an aperture into an inner den, where
the miserable ascetic, who inhabited this dwelling, probably slept.
At full tide, egress and regress are hardly practicable. As Regulus
first colonised the metropolitan see of Scotland, and converted the
inhabitants in the vicinity, he has some reason to complain that the
ancient name of Killrule (<i>Cella Reguli</i>) should have been superseded,
even in favour of the tutelar saint of Scotland. The reason of the change
was, that St. Rule is said to have brought to Scotland the relics of
Saint Andrew.&rsquo;-SCOTT.<br>
<br>
<b>line 509</b>. &lsquo;St. Fillan was a Scottish saint of some reputation.
Although Popery is, with us, matter of abomination, yet the common people
still retain some of the superstitions connected with it. There are
in Perthshire several wells and springs dedicated to St. Fillan, which
are still places of pilgrimage and offerings, even among the Protestants.
They are held powerful in cases of madness; and, in some of very late
occurrence, lunatics have been left all night bound to the holy stone,
in confidence that the saint would cure and unloose them before morning.

<b>INTRODUCTION TO CANTO SECOND</b>.<br>
<br>
The Rev. John Marriott, A. M., to whom this introductory poem is dedicated,
was tutor to George Henry, Lord Scott, son of Charles, Earl of Dalkeith,
afterwards fourth Duke of Buccleuch and sixth of Queensberry. Lord Scott
died early, in 1808. Marriott, while still at Oxford, proved himself
a capable poet, and Scott shewed his appreciation of him by including
two of his ballads at the close of the &lsquo;Minstrelsy of the Scottish
Border.&rsquo; The concluding lines of this Introduction refer to Marriott&rsquo;s
ballads.<br>
<br>
<b>line 2</b>. &lsquo;Ettrick Forest, now a range of mountainous sheep-walks,
was anciently reserved for the pleasure of the royal chase. Since it
was disparked, the wood has been, by degrees, almost totally destroyed,
although, wherever protected from the sheep, copses soon arise without
any planting. When the King hunted there, he often summoned the array
of the country to meet and assist his sport. Thus, in 1528, James V
&ldquo;made proclamation to all lords, barons, gentlemen, landward-men,
and freeholders, that they should compear at Edinburgh, with a month&rsquo;s
victuals, to pass with the King where he pleased, to danton the thieves
of Tiviotdale, Annandale, Liddisdale, and other parts of that country;
and also warned all gentlemen that had good dogs to bring them, that
he might hunt in the said country as he pleased: The whilk the Earl
of Argyle, the Earl of Huntley, the Earl of Athole, and so all the rest
of the gentlemen of the Highland, did, and brought their hounds with
them in like manner, to hunt with the King, as he pleased.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;&ldquo;The second day of June the King past out of Edinburgh
to the hunting, with many of the nobles and gentlemen of Scotland with
him, to the number of twelve thousand men; and then past to Meggitland,
and hounded and hawked all the country and bounds; that is to say, Crammat,
Pappert-law, St. Mary-laws, Carlavirick, Chapel, Ewindoores, and Langhope.
I heard say, he slew, in these bounds, eighteen score of harts.&rdquo;
PITSCOTTIE&rsquo;S <i>History of Scotland</i>, folio edition, p. 143.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;These huntings had, of course, a military character, and attendance
upon them was part of the duty of a vassal. The act for abolishing ward
or military tenures in Scotland, enumerates the services of hunting,
hosting, watching and warding, as those which were in future to be illegal.&rsquo;-SCOTT.<br>
<br>
<b>lines 5-11</b>. Cp. Wordsworth&rsquo;s &lsquo;Thorn&rsquo;:-<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;There is a Thorn-it looks so old,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In truth, you&rsquo;d find it hard
to say<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How it could ever have been young,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It looks so old and grey.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
There is a special suggestion of antiquity in the wrinkled, lichen-covered
thorn of a wintry landscape, and thus it is a fitting object to stir
and sustain the poet&rsquo;s tendency to note &lsquo;chance and change&rsquo;
and to lament the loss of the days that are no more. The exceeding appropriateness
of this in a narrative poem dealing with departed habits and customs
must be quite apparent. The thorn grows to a very great age, and many
an unpretentious Scottish homestead receives a pathetic grace and dignity
from the presence of its ancestral thorn-tree.<br>
<br>
<b>line 15</b>. The rowan is the mountain ash. One of the most tender

<br>
<b>line 27</b>. There are some notable allusions in the poets to the
moonlight baying of dogs and wolves. Cp. Julius Caesar, iv. 3. 27:-<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;I had rather be a dog and bay the
moon.&rsquo;<br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;While the wolf, in nightly prowl,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bays the moon with hideous howl!&rsquo;<br>
<br>
One of the best lines in English verse on the wolf-both skilfully onomatopoeic
and suggestively picturesque-is Campbell&rsquo;s, line 66 of &lsquo;Pleasures
of Hope&rsquo;:-<br>

reservoir from which the Yarrow takes its source. It is connected with
a smaller lake, called the Loch of the Lowes, and surrounded by mountains.
In the winter, it is still frequented by flights of wild swans; hence
my friend Mr. Wordsworth&rsquo;s lines:-<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The swan on sweet St. Mary&rsquo;s
lake<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floats double, swan and shadow.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Near the lower extremity of the lake are the ruins of Dryhope tower,
the birth-place of Mary Scott, daughter of Philip Scott of Dryhope,
and famous by the traditional name of the Flower of Yarrow. She was
married to Walter Scott of Harden, no less renowned for his depredations
than his bride for her beauty. Her romantic appellation was, in latter
days, with equal justice, conferred on Miss Mary Lilias Scott, the last
of the elder branch of the Harden family. The author well remembers
the talent and spirit of the latter Flower of Yarrow, though age had
then injured the charms which procured her the name. The words usually
sung to the air of &ldquo;Tweedside,&rdquo; beginning &ldquo;What beauties
does Flora disclose,&rdquo; were composed in her honour.&rsquo;-SCOTT.<br>
<br>
Quoting from memory, Scott gives &lsquo;sweet&rsquo; for <i>still</i>
in Wordsworth&rsquo;s lines. Mr. Aubrey de Vere, in &lsquo;Essays Chiefly
on Poetry,&rsquo; ii. 277, reports an interview with Wordsworth, in
which the poet, referring to St. Mary&rsquo;s Lake, says: &lsquo;The
scene when I saw it, with its still and dim lake, under the dusky hills,
was one of utter loneliness; there was one swan, and one only, stemming
the water, and the pathetic loneliness of the region gave importance
to the one companion of that swan-its own white image in the water.&rsquo;
For a criticism, deeply sympathetic and appreciative, of Scott&rsquo;s
description of St. Mary&rsquo;s Loch in calm, see Prof. Veitch&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Feeling for Nature in Scottish Poetry,&rsquo; ii. 196. The scene
remains very much what it was in Scott&rsquo;s time, &lsquo;notwithstanding
that the hand of the Philistine,&rsquo; says Prof. Veitch, &lsquo;has
set along the north shore of St. Mary&rsquo;s, as far as his power extended,
a strip of planting.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<b>line 177</b>. &lsquo;The chapel of St. Mary of the Lowes {<i>de lacubus</i>}
was situated on the eastern side of the lake, to which it gives name.
It was injured by the clan of Scott, in a feud with the Cranstouns;
but continued to be a place of worship during the seventeenth century.
The vestiges of the building can now scarcely be traced; but the burial-ground
is still used as a cemetery. A funeral, in a spot so very retired, has
an uncommonly striking effect. The vestiges of the chaplain&rsquo;s
house are yet visible. Being in a high situation, it commanded a full
view of the lake, with the opposite mountain of Bourhope, belonging,
with the lake itself, to Lord Napier. On the left hand is the tower
of Dryhope, mentioned in a preceding note.&rsquo;-SCOTT.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sighs the sad genius of the coming

<br>
<b>line 204</b>. &lsquo;At one corner of the burial-ground of the demolished
chapel, but without its precincts, is a small mound, called <i>Binrams
Corse</i>, where tradition deposits the remains of a necromantic priest,
the former tenant of the chaplainry. His story much resembles that of
Ambrosio in &ldquo;The Monk,&rdquo; and has been made the theme of a
ballad by my friend Mr. James Hogg, more poetically designed the <i>Ettrick
Shepherd</i>. To his volume, entitled &ldquo;The Mountain Bard,&rdquo;
which contains this, and many other legendary stories and ballads of
great merit, I refer the curious reader.&rsquo;-SCOTT.<br>
<br>
<b>line 239</b>. &lsquo;Loch-skene is a mountain lake, of considerable
size, at the head of the Moffat-water. The character of the scenery
is uncommonly savage; and the earn, or Scottish eagle, has, for many
ages, built its nest yearly upon an islet in the lake. Loch-skene discharges
itself into a brook, which, after a short and precipitate course, falls
from a cataract of immense height and gloomy grandeur, called, from
its appearance, the &ldquo;Grey Mare&rsquo;s Tail.&rdquo; The &ldquo;Giant&rsquo;s
Grave,&rdquo; afterwards mentioned, is a sort of trench, which bears
that name, a little way from the foot of the cataract. It has the appearance
of a battery designed to command the pass.&rsquo;-SCOTT.<br>

Tod Stoddart, well known as poet and angler on the Borders during the

the first to punctuate the passage thus.<br>
<br>
<b>line 9</b>. &lsquo;The Abbey of Whitby, in the Archdeaconry of Cleaveland,
on the coast of Yorkshire, was founded A. D. 657, in consequence of
a vow of Oswy, King of Northumberland. It contained both monks and nuns
of the Benedictine order; but, contrary to what was usual in such establishments,
the abbess was superior to the abbot. The monastery was afterwards mined
by the Danes, and rebuilded by William Percy, in the reign of the Conqueror.
There were no nuns there in Henry the Eighth&rsquo;s time, nor long
before it. The ruins of Whitby Abbey are very magnificent.&rsquo;-SCOTT.<br>
<br>
<b>line 10</b>. &lsquo;Lindisfarne, an isle on the coast of Northumberland,
was called Holy Island, from the sanctity of its ancient monastery,
and from its having been the episcopal seat of the see of Durham during
the early ages of British Christianity. A succession of holy men held
that office: but their merits were swallowed up in the superior fame
of St. Cuthbert, who was sixth bishop of Durham, and who bestowed the
name of his &ldquo;patrimony&rdquo; upon the extensive property of the
see. The ruins of the monastery upon Holy Island betoken great antiquity.
The arches are, in general, strictly Saxon, and the pillars which support
them, short, strong, and massy. In some places, however, there are pointed
windows, which indicate that the building has been repaired at a period
long subsequent to the original foundation. The exterior ornaments of
the building, being of a light sandy stone, have been wasted, as described
in the text. Lindisfarne is not properly an island, but rather, as the
Venerable Bede has termed it, a semi-isle; for, although surrounded
by the sea at full tide, the ebb leaves the sands dry between it and
the opposite coast of Northumberland, from which it is about three miles
distant.&rsquo;-SCOTT.<br>
<br>
The monastery, of which the present ruins remain, was built, between
1093 and 1120, by Benedictine monks under the direction of William Carileph,
Bishop of Durham. There were sixteen bishops in Holy Island between
St. Aidan (635 A. D.) and Eardulph (875 A. D.). The Christians were
dispersed after the violent inroad of the Danes in 868, and for two
centuries Lindisfarne suffered apparent relapse. Lindisfarne (Gael.
<i>farne</i>, a retreat) signifies &lsquo;a place of retreat by the
brook Lindis.&rsquo; The name Holy Island was given by Carileph&rsquo;s
monks, to commemorate, they said, &lsquo;the sacred blood which had
been shed by the Danes.&rsquo; See Raine&rsquo;s &lsquo;History of North
Durham,&rsquo; F. R. Wilson&rsquo;s &lsquo;Churches of Lindisfarne,&rsquo;

<b>Stanza XIII. line 234</b>. Scott quotes from &lsquo;A True Account,&rsquo;
circulated at Whitby, concerning the consequences of a boar-hunt on
Eskdale-side, belonging to the Abbot of Whitby. The boar, being hard
pressed, made for a hermitage and died just within the door. Coming
up, the three leaders-William de Bruce, Lord of Uglebarnby, Ralph de
Percy, Lord of Smeaton, and a freeholder named Allatson-in their disappointment
and wrath set upon the hermit, whom they fatally wounded. When the abbot
afterwards came to the dying hermit, and told him his assailants would
suffer extreme penalty for their ruthless conduct, the hermit asked
the gentlemen to be sent for, and said he would pardon them on certain
conditions. &lsquo;The gentlemen being present bade him save their lives.-Then
said the hermit, &ldquo;You and yours shall hold your lands of the Abbot
of Whitby, and his successors, in this manner: That, upon Ascension-day,
you, or some of you, shall come to the wood of the Stray-heads, which
is in Eskdale-side, the same day at sun-rising, and there shall the
abbot&rsquo;s officer blow his horn, to the intent that you may know
where to find him; and he shall deliver unto you, William de Bruce,
ten stakes, eleven strout stowers, and eleven yethers, to be cut by
you, or some of you, with a knife of one penny price: and you, Ralph
de Percy, shall take twenty-one of each sort, to be cut in the same
manner; and you, Allatson, shall take nine of each sort, to be cut as
aforesaid, and to be taken on your backs and carried to the town of
Whitby, and to be there before nine of the clock the same day before
mentioned. At the same hour of nine of the clock, if it be full sea,
your labour and service shall cease; and if low water, each of you shall
set your stakes to the brim, each stake one yard from the other, and
so yether them on each side with your yethers; and so stake on each
side with your strout stowers, that they may stand three tides, without
removing by the force thereof. Each of you shall do, make, and execute
the said service, at that very hour, every year, except it be fall sea
at that hour; but when it shall so fall out, this service shall cease.
You shall faithfully do this, in remembrance that you did most cruelly
slay me; and that you may the better call to God for mercy, repent unfeignedly
of your sins, and do good works. The officer of Eskdale-side shall blow,
<i>Out on you! Out on you! Out on you!</i> for this heinous crime. If
you, or your successors, shall refuse this service, so long as it shall
not be full sea at the aforesaid hour, you or yours shall forfeit your
lands to the Abbot of Whitby, or his successors. This I entreat, and
earnestly beg, that you may have lives and goods preserved for this
service: and I request of you to promise, by your parts in Heaven, that
it shall be done by you and your successors, as is aforesaid requested;
and I will confirm it by the faith of an honest man.&rdquo;-Then the
hermit said, &ldquo;My soul longeth for the Lord: and I do as freely
forgive these men my death, as Christ forgave the thieves on the cross.&rdquo;
And, in the presence of the abbot and the rest, he said moreover these
words: &ldquo;<i>In manus tuos, Domine, commendo spiritum meum, a vinculis
enim mortis redemisti me, Domine veritatis, Amen</i>.&rdquo;-So he yielded
up the ghost the eighth day of December, anno Domini 1159, whose soul
God have mercy upon. Amen.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;&ldquo;This service,&rdquo; it is added, &ldquo;still continues
to be performed with the prescribed ceremonies, though not by the proprietors
in person. Part of the lands charged therewith are now held by a gentleman
of the name of Herbert.&rdquo;&lsquo;-SCOTT.<br>
<br>
<b>line 244</b>. Edelfled &lsquo;was the daughter of King Oswy, who,
in gratitude to Heaven for the great victory which he won in 655, against
Penda, the pagan King of Mercia, dedicated Edelfleda, then but a year
old, to the service of God, in the monastery of Whitby, of which St.
Hilda was then abbess. She afterwards adorned the place of her education
with great magnificence.&rsquo;-SCOTT.<br>
<br>
<b>line 251</b>. &lsquo;These two miracles are much insisted on by all
ancient writers who have occasion to mention either Whitby or St. Hilda.
The relics of the snakes, which infested the precincts of the convent,
and were at the abbess&rsquo;s prayer not only beheaded but petrified,
are still found about the rocks, and are termed by Protestant fossilists,
<i>Ammonitae</i>.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;The other miracle is thus mentioned by Camden: &ldquo;It is also
ascribed to the power of her sanctity, that these wild geese, which,
in the winter, fly in great flocks to the lakes and rivers unfrozen
in the southern parts, to the great amazement of every one, fall down
suddenly upon the ground, when they are in their flight over certain
&lsquo;neighbouring fields hereabouts: a relation I should not have
made, if I had not received it from several credible men. But those
who are less inclined to heed superstition, attribute it to some occult
quality in the ground, and to somewhat of antipathy between it and the
geese, such as they say is betwixt wolves and scyllaroots: for that
such hidden tendencies and aversions, as we call sympathies and antipathies,
are implanted in many things by provident Nature for the preservation
of them, is a thing so evident, that everybody grants it.&rdquo; Mr.
Chariton, in his History of Whitby, points out the true origin of the
fable, from the number of sea-gulls that, when flying from a storm,
often alight near Whitby; and from the woodcocks, and other birds of
passage, who do the same upon their arrival on shore, after a long flight.&rsquo;-SCOTT.<br>
<br>
<b>Stanza XIV. line 257</b>. &lsquo;St. Cuthbert was, in the choice
of his sepulchre, one of the most mutable and unreasonable saints in
the Calendar. He died A. D. 688, in a hermitage upon the Farne Islands,
having resigned the bishopric of Lindisfarne, or Holy Island, about
two years before. <a name="citation1"></a><a href="#footnote1">{1}</a>&nbsp;
His body was brought to Lindisfarne, where it remained until a descent
of the Danes, about 793, when the monastery was nearly destroyed. The
monks fled to Scotland, with what they deemed their chief treasure,
the relics of St. Cuthbert. The Saint was, however, a most capricious
fellow-traveller; which was the more intolerable, as, like Sinbad&rsquo;s
Old Man of the Sea, he journeyed upon the shoulders of his companions.
They paraded him through Scotland for several years, and came as far
west as Whithorn, in Galloway, whence they attempted to sail for Ireland,
but were driven back by tempests. He at length made a halt at Norham;
from thence he went to Melrose, where he remained stationary for a short
time, and then caused himself to be launched upon the Tweed in a stone
coffin, which landed him at Tilmouth, in Northumberland. This boat is
finely shaped, ten feet long, three feet and a half in diameter, and
only four inches thick; so that, with very little assistance, it might
certainly have swam: it still lies, or at least did so a few years ago,
in two pieces, beside the ruined chapel at Tilmouth. From Tilmouth,
Cuthbert wandered into Yorkshire; and at length made a long stay at
Chester-le-street, to which the bishop&rsquo;s see was transferred.
At length, the Danes continuing to infest the country, the monks removed
to Rippon for a season; and it was in return from thence to Chester-le-street,
that, passing through a forest called Dunholme, the Saint and his carriage
became immovable at a place named Wardlaw, or Wardilaw. Here the Saint
chose his place of residence; and all who have seen Durham must admit,
that, if difficult in his choice, he evinced taste in at last fixing
it. It is said, that the Northumbrian Catholics still keep secret the
precise spot of the Saint&rsquo;s sepulture, which is only intrusted
to three persons at a time. When one dies the survivors associate to
them, in his room, a person judged fit to be the depositary of so valuable
a secret.&rsquo;-SCOTT.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;The resting-place of the remains of this Saint is not now matter
of uncertainty. So recently as 17th May, 1827,-1139 years after his
death-their discovery and disinterment were effected. Under a blue stone,
in the middle of the shrine of St. Cuthbert, at the eastern extremity
of the choir of Durham Cathedral, there was then found a walled grave,
containing the coffins of the Saint. The first, or outer one, was ascertained
to be that of 1541, the second of 1041; the third, or inner one, answering
in every particular to the description of that of 698, was found to
contain, not indeed, as had been averred then, and even until 1539,
the incorruptible body, but the entire skeleton of the Saint; the bottom
of the grave being perfectly dry, free from offensive smell, and without
the slightest symptom that a human body had ever undergone decomposition
within its walls. The skeleton was found swathed in five silk robes
of emblematical embroidery, the ornamental parts laid with gold leaf,
and these again covered with a robe of linen. Beside the skeleton were
also deposited several gold and silver insignia, and other relics of
the Saint.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;(The Roman Catholics now allow that the coffin was that of St.
Cuthbert.)<br>
<br>
&lsquo;The bones of the Saint were again restored to the grave in a
new coffin, amid the fragments of the former ones. Those portions of
the inner coffin which could be preserved, including one of its rings,
with the silver altar, golden cross, stole, comb, two maniples, bracelets,
girdle, gold wire of the skeleton, and fragments of the five silk robes,
and seme of the rings of the outer coffin made in 1541, were deposited
in the library of the Dean and Chapter, where they are now preserved.&rsquo;-LOCKHART.<br>

<br>
<b>Stanza XV. line 292</b>. &lsquo;Every one has heard, that when David
I, with his son Henry, invaded Northumberland in 1136, the English host
marched against them under the holy banner of St. Cuthbert; to the efficacy
of which was imputed the great victory which they obtained in the bloody
battle of Northallerton, or Cuton-moor. The conquerors were at least
as much indebted to the jealousy and intractability of the different
tribes who composed David&rsquo;s army; among whom, as mentioned in
the text, were the Galwegians, the Britons of Strath-Clyde, the men
of Teviotdale and Lothian, with many Norman and German warriors, who
asserted the cause of the Empress Maud. See Chalmers&rsquo;s &ldquo;Caledonia,&rdquo;
vol. i. p. 622; a most laborious, curious, and interesting publication,
from which considerable defects of style and manner ought not to turn
aside the Scottish antiquary.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Cuthbert, we have seen, had no great reason, to spare the Danes,
when opportunity offered. Accordingly, I find in Simeon of Durham, that
the Saint appeared in a vision to Alfred, when lurking in the marches
of Glastonbury, and promised him assistance and victory over his heathen
enemies; a consolation which, as was reasonable, Alfred, after the battle
of Ashendown, rewarded, by a royal offering at the shrine of the Saint.
As to William the Conqueror, the terror spread before his army, when
he marched to punish the revolt of the Northumbrians, in 1096, had forced
the monks to fly once more to Holy Island with the body of the Saint.
It was, however, replaced before William left the north; and, to balance
accounts, the Conqueror having intimated an indiscreet curiosity to
view the Saint&rsquo;s body, he was, while in the act of commanding
the shrine to be opened, seized with heat and sickness, accompanied
with such a panic terror, that, notwithstanding there was a sumptuous
dinner prepared for him, he fled without eating a morsel (which the
monkish historian seems to have thought no small part both of the miracle
and the penance,) and never drew his bridle till he got to the river
Tees.&rsquo;-SCOTT.<br>
<br>
<b>Stanza XVI. line 300</b>. &lsquo;Although we do not learn that Cuthbert
was, during his life, such an artificer as Dunstan, his brother in sanctity,
yet, since his death, he has acquired the reputation of forging those
<i>Entrochi </i>which are found among the rocks of Holy Island, and
pass there by the name of St. Cuthbert&rsquo;s Beads. While at this
task, he is supposed to sit during the night upon a certain rock, and
use another as his anvil. This story was perhaps credited in former
days; at least the Saint&rsquo;s legend contains some not more probable.&rsquo;-SCOTT.<br>
<br>
See in Mr. Aubrey de Vere&rsquo;s &lsquo;Legends of the Saxon Saints&rsquo;
a fine poem entitled &lsquo;How Saint Cuthbert kept his Pentecost at
Carlisle.&rsquo; The &lsquo;beads&rsquo; are there referred to thus:-<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;And many an age, when slept that
Saint in death,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passing his isle by night the sailor
heard<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Cuthbert&rsquo;s hammer clinking
on the rock.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
The recognised name of these shells is still &lsquo;St. Cuthbert&rsquo;s
beads.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<b>Stanza XVII. line 316</b>. &lsquo;Ceolwolf, or Colwulf, King of Northumberland,
flourished in the eighth century. He was a man of some learning; for
the venerable Bede dedicates to him his &ldquo;Ecclesiastical History.&rdquo;
He abdicated the throne about 738, and retired to Holy Island, where
he died in the odour of sanctity. Saint as Colwulf was, however, I fear
the foundation of the penance-vault does not correspond with his character;
for it is recorded among his memorabilia, that, finding the air of the
island raw and cold, he indulged the monks, whose rule had hitherto
confined them to milk or water, with the comfortable privilege of using
wine or ale. If any rigid antiquary insists on this objection, he is
welcome to suppose the penance-vault was intended by the founder for
the more genial purposes of a cellar.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;These penitential vaults were the <i>Geissel-gewolbe</i> of German
convents. In the earlier and more rigid times of monastic discipline,
they were sometimes used as a cemetery for the lay benefactor of the
convent, whose unsanctified corpses were then seldom permitted to pollute
the choir. They also served as places of meeting for the chapter, when
measures of uncommon severity were to be adopted. But their most frequent
use, as implied by the name,<br>
was as places for performing penances, or undergoing punishment.&rsquo;-SCOTT.<br>

<br>
<b>Stanza XIX. line 371</b>. &lsquo;That there was an ancient priory
at Tynemouth is certain. Its ruins are situated on a high rocky point;
and, doubtless, many a vow was made to the shrine by the distressed
mariners, who drove towards the iron-bound coast of Northumberland in
stormy weather. It was anciently a nunnery; for Virca, abbess of Tynemouth,
presented St. Cuthbert (yet alive) with a rare winding-sheet, in emulation
of a holy lady called Tuda, who had sent him a coffin: but, as in the
case of Whitby, and of Holy Island, the introduction of nuns at Tynemouth,
in the reign of Henry VIII, is an anachronism. The nunnery of Holy Island
is altogether fictitious. Indeed, St. Cuthbert was unlikely to permit
such an establishment; for, notwithstanding his accepting the mortuary
gifts above mentioned, and his carrying on a visiting acquaintance with
the abbess of Coldingham, he certainly hated the whole female sex; and,
in revenge of a slippery trick played to him by an Irish princess, he,
after death, inflicted severe penances on such as presumed to approach
within a certain distance of his shrine.&rsquo;-SCOTT.<br>
<br>
<b>line 376. ruth</b> (A. S. <i>hreow</i>, pity) in Early and Middle
English was used both for &lsquo;disaster&rsquo; and &lsquo;pity.&rsquo;
These two shades of meaning are illustrated by Spenser in F. Q., Bk.
ii. I. Introd. to Canto where Falsehood beguiles the Red Cross Knight,
and &lsquo;workes him woefull ruth,&rsquo; and in F. Q. I. v. 9:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Great <i>ruth</i> in all the gazers
hearts did grow.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
Milton (Lycidas, 163) favours the poetical employment of the word, which
modern poets continue to use. Cp. Wordsworth, &lsquo;Ode for a General
Thanksgiving&rsquo;:-<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Assaulting without <i>ruth<br>

one of the richest abbeys in France. It was a retreat for penitents
of both sexes, and presided over by an abbess. &lsquo;The old monastic
buildings and courtyards, surrounded by walls, and covering from 40
to 50 acres, now form one of the larger prisons of France, in which
about 2000 men and boys are confined, and kept at industrial occupations.&rsquo;

<b>line 414</b>. Byron, writing to Murray on 3 Feb., 1816, expresses
his belief that he has unwittingly imitated this passage in &lsquo;Parisina.&rsquo;
&lsquo;I had,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;completed the story on the passage
from Gibbon, which indeed leads to a like scene naturally, without a
thought of the kind; but it comes upon me not very comfortably.&rsquo;
Byron is quite right in his assertion that, if he had taken this striking
description of Constance as a model for his Parisina, he would have
been attempting &lsquo;to imitate that which is inimitable.&rsquo; See
&lsquo;Parisina,&rsquo; st. xiv:-<br>

<b>Stanza XXIII. line 438. grisly</b>, grim, horrible; still an effective

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;The haggard father&rsquo;s face
and reverend beard<br>

<br>
See below, III. 382.<br>
<br>
<b>Stanza XXV. line 468</b>. &lsquo;It is well known, that the religious,
who broke their vows of chastity, were subjected to the same penalty
as the Roman vestals in a similar case. A small niche, sufficient to
enclose their bodies, was made in the massive wall of the convent; a
slender pittance of food and water was deposited in it, and the awful
words, VADE IN PACE, were the signal for immuring the criminal. It is
not likely that, in latter times, this punishment was often resorted
to; but among the ruins of the abbey of Coldingham, were some years
ago discovered the remains of a female skeleton, which, from the shape
of the niche, and position of the figure, seemed to be that of an immured
nun.&rsquo;-SCOTT.<br>
<br>
Lockhart adds:-&lsquo;The Edinburgh Reviewer, on st. xxxii, <i>post</i>,
suggests that the proper reading of the sentence is <i>vade in pacem</i>-not
<i>part in peace</i>, but <i>go into peace</i>, or eternal rest, a pretty
intelligible mittimus to another world.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<b>Stanza XXVII. line 506. my</b> = &lsquo;of me,&rsquo; retains the

<b>lines 524-40</b>. The reference in these lines is to what was known
as the appeal to the judgment of God. On this subject, Scott at the
close of the second head in his &lsquo;Essay on Chivalry,&rsquo; says,
&lsquo;In the appeal to this awful criterion, the combatants, whether
personally concerned, or appearing as champions, were understood, in
martial law, to take on themselves the full risk of all consequences.
And, as the defendant, or his champion, in case of being overcome, was
subjected to the punishment proper to the crime of which he was accused,
so the appellant, if vanquished, was, whether a principal or substitute,
condemned to the same doom to which his success would have exposed the
accused. Whichever combatant was vanquished he was liable to the penalty
of degradation; and, if he survived the combat, the disgrace to which
he was subjected was worse than death. His spurs were cut off close
to his heels, with a cook&rsquo;s cleaver; his arms were baffled and
reversed by the common hangman; his belt was cut to pieces, and his
sword broken. Even his horse shared his disgrace, the animal&rsquo;s
tail being cut off, close by the rump, and thrown on a dunghill. The
death-bell tolled, and the funeral service was said for a knight thus
degraded as for one dead to knightly honour. And if he fell in the appeal
to the judgment of God, the same dishonour was done to his senseless
corpse. If alive, he was only rescued from death to be confined in the
cloister. Such at least were the strict roles of Chivalry, though the
courtesy of the victor, or the clemency of the prince, might remit them
in favourable cases.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
For illustration of forms observed at such contests, see Richard II,
i. 3.<br>
<br>
<b>line 524</b>. Each knight declared on oath that he &lsquo;had his
quarrel just.&rsquo; The fall of an unworthy knight is referred to below,

<br>
<b>Stanza XXIX. line 545</b>. This illustrates Henry&rsquo;s impulsive
and imperious character, and is not, necessarily, a premonition of his
final attitude towards Roman Catholicism.<br>
<br>
<b>line 555. dastard</b> (Icel. <i>doestr</i> = exhausted, breathless;
O. Dut. <i>dasaert</i> = a fool) is very appropriately used here, after
the description above, St. xxii, to designate the poltroon that quails
only before death. Cp. Pope&rsquo;s Iliad, II. 427:-<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;And die the dastard first, who
dreads to die.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<b>Stanza XXX. line 568</b>. Cp. Julius Caesar, ii. 2. 35:-<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;It seems to me most strange that
men should fear;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that death, a necessary end,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will come when it will come.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<b>Stanza XXXI. line 573. the fiery Dane</b>. See note on line 10 above.
Passing northwards after destroying York and Tynemouth, the Danes in
875 burned the monastery on Lindisfarne. The bishop and monks, with
their relics and the body of St. Cuthbert, fled over the Kylve hills.
See Raine, &amp;c.<br>
<br>
<b>line 576. the crosier bends</b>. Crosier (O. Fr. <i>croiser</i>;
Fr. <i>croix</i> = cross) is used both for the staff of an archbishop
with a cross on the top, and for the staff of a bishop or an abbot,
terminating in a carved or ornamented curve or crook. The word is used
here metaphorically for Papal power, as Bacon uses it, speaking of Anselm
and Becket, &lsquo;who with their <i>crosiers</i> did almost try it
with the king&rsquo;s sword.&rsquo; Constance&rsquo;s prophecy refers
to Henry VIII&rsquo;s victorious collision with the Pope.<br>
<br>
<b>Stanza XXXII. lines 585-91</b>. It is impossible not to connect this
striking picture with that of Virgil&rsquo;s Sibyl (Aeneid, VI. 45):-<br>

iii. 2. 55.<br>
<br>
<b>line 620</b>. The custom of ringing the <i>passing</i> bell grew
out of the belief that a church bell, rung when the soul was passing
from the body, terrified the devils that were waiting to attack it at
the moment of its escape. &lsquo;The tolling of the passing bell was
retained at the Reformation; and the people were instructed that its
use was to admonish the living, and excite them to pray for the dying.
But by the beginning of the l8th century the passing bell in the proper
sense of the term had almost ceased to be heard. &lsquo;A mourning bell
is still rung during funeral services as a mark of respect. See <i>s.
v.</i> &lsquo;Bell,&rsquo; Chambers&rsquo;s Encyclopaedia. Cp. Byron&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Parisina,&rsquo; St. xv.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;The convent bells are ringing,<br>

and fro.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
In criticising &lsquo;Marmion,&rsquo; in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>,
Lord Jeffrey says that the sound of the knell rung for Constance &lsquo;is
described with great force and solemnity;&rsquo; while a writer in the
<i>Scots Magazine</i> of 1808 considers that &lsquo;the whole of this
trial and doom presents a high-wrought scene of horror, which, at the
close, rises almost to too great a pitch.&rsquo;<br>

<br>
<b>INTRODUCTION TO CANTO THIRD.<br>
<br>
</b>&lsquo;William Erskine, Esq. advocate, sheriff-depute of the Orkneys,
became a Judge of the Court of Session by the title of Lord Kinnedder,
and died in Edinburgh in August, 1823. He had been from early youth
the most intimate of the Poet&rsquo;s friends, and his chief confidant
and adviser as to all literary matters. See a notice of his life and
character by the late Mr. Hay Donaldson, to which Sir Walter Scott contributed
several paragraphs.&rsquo;-LOCKHART.<br>
<br>
There are frequent references to Erskine throughout Lockhart&rsquo;s
Life of Scott. The critics of the time were of his opinion that Scott
as a poet was not giving his powers their proper direction. Jeffrey
considered Marmion &lsquo;a misapplication in some degree of extraordinary
talents.&rsquo; Fortunately, Scott decided for himself in the matter,
and the self-criticism of this Introduction is characterised not only
by good humour and poetic beauty but by discrimination and strong common-sense.<br>
<br>
<b>line 14. a morning dream</b>. This may simply be a poetic way of
saying that his method is unsystematic, but Horace&rsquo;s account of
the vision he saw when he was once tempted to write Greek verses is
irresistibly suggested by the expression:-<br>

<b>line 24. all too well</b>. This use of &lsquo;all too&rsquo; is a
development of the Elizabethan expression &lsquo;all-to&rsquo; = <i>altogether,

to ruffled,&rsquo; Comus, 380. In this usage the original force of <i>to</i>
as a verbal prefix is lost sight of. Chaucer has &lsquo;The pot to breaketh&rsquo;
in Prologue to Chanon Yeomanes Tale. See note in Clarendon Press Milton,

<br>
<b>line 28</b>. The reading of the first edition is &lsquo;loftier,&rsquo;
which conveys an estimate of his own achievements more characteristic
of Scott than the bare assertion of his ability to &lsquo;build the
lofty rhyme&rsquo; which is implied in the line as it stands. Perhaps
the expression just quoted from &lsquo;Lycidas&rsquo; may have led to
the reading of all subsequent editions.<br>

that time to the present there has been a very remarkable development
of government and power. See Carlyle&rsquo;s &lsquo;Frederick the Great,&rsquo;

and so failed to crush the dragon of the French Revolution in its birth,

<br>
<b>line 69</b>. Various German princes lost their dominions after Napoleon
conquered Prussia.<br>
<br>
<b>line 78</b>. By defeating Varus, A. D. 9, Arminius saved Germany
from Roman conquest. See the first two books of the Annals of Tacitus,
at the close of which this tribute is paid to the hero: &lsquo;liberator
haud dubie Germaniae et qui non primordia populi Romani, sicut alii
reges ducesque, sed florentissimum imperium lacessierit, proeliis ambiguus,
bello non victus.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<b>lines 46-80</b>. This undoubtedly vigorous and well-sustained tribute
is not without its special purpose. The Princess Caroline was daughter
of the Duke of Brunswick, and Scott was one of those who believed in
her, in spite of that &lsquo;careless levity&rsquo; which he did not
fail to note in her demeanour when presented at her Court at Blackheath
in 1806. This passage on the Duke of Brunswick had been read by the
Princess before the appearance of &lsquo;Marmion.&rsquo; Lockhart (Life
of Scott, ii. 117) says: &lsquo;He seems to have communicated fragments
of the poem very freely during the whole of its progress. As early as
the 22nd February, 1807, I find Mrs. Hayman acknowledging, in the name
of the Princess of Wales, the receipt of a copy of the Introduction
to Canto III, in which occurs the tribute to her Royal Highness&rsquo;s
heroic father, mortally wounded the year before at Jena-a tribute so
grateful to her feelings that she herself shortly after sent the poet
an elegant silver vase as a memorial of her thankfulness.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<b>line 81</b>. The Red-Cross hero is Sir Sidney Smith, the famous admiral,
who belonged to the Order of Knights Templars. The eight-pointed Templar&rsquo;s
cross which he wore throughout his career is said to have belonged to
Richard Coeur-de-Lion. In early life, with consent of the Government,
Smith distinguished himself with the Swedes in their war with Russia.
He was frequently entrusted with the duty of alarming the French coast,
and once was captured and imprisoned, in the Temple at Paris, for two
years. His escape was effected by a daring stratagem on the part of
the French Royalist party. He and his sailors helped the Turks to retain
St. Jean d&rsquo;Acre against Napoleon, till then the &lsquo;Invincible,&rsquo;
who retired baffled after a vain siege of sixty days (May, 1799). Had
Acre been won, said Napoleon afterwards, &lsquo;I would have reached
Constantinople and the Indies-I would have changed the face of the world.&rsquo;

the expedition to Egypt, 1800-1, and fell at the battle of Alexandria.
Sir Sidney Smith was wounded in the same battle, and had to go home.<br>
<br>
<b>lines 100-10</b>. Scott pays compliment to his friend Joanna Baillie
(1764-1851), with chivalrous courtesy asserting that she is the first
worthy successor of Shakespeare. &lsquo;Count Basil&rsquo; and &lsquo;De
Montfort&rsquo; are the two most remarkable of her &lsquo;Plays of the
Passions,&rsquo; of which she published three volumes. &lsquo;De Montfort&rsquo;
was played in London, Kemble enacting the hero. Several of Miss Baillie&rsquo;s
Scottish songs are among standard national lyrics.<br>

<b>line 137. hind</b>, from Early Eng. <i>hyne</i>, servant (A. S. <i>hina</i>)
is quite distinct from hind, a female stag. Gavin Douglas, translating

Shakespeare (Merry Wives, iii. 5. 94) uses the word as servant, &lsquo;A

The modern usage implies a farm-bailiff or simply a farm-servant.<br>
<br>
<b>line 149</b>. Lochaber is a large district in the south of Invernesshire,

in the sense of disagreeing, is still in common use in Scotland both
as an adj. and a participle. &lsquo;They discorded&rsquo; indicates
that two disputants approached without quite reaching a serious quarrel.
In a note to the second edition of the poem Scott states that the couplet
beginning &lsquo;whose doom&rsquo; is &lsquo;unconsciously borrowed
from a passage in Dryden&rsquo;s beautiful epistle to John Driden of
Chesterton.&rsquo; Dryden&rsquo;s lines are:-<br>
<br>

<b>Stanza I</b>. Mr. Guthrie Wright, advocate, prosaically objected
to the indirect route chosen by the poet for his troopers. Scott gave
the true poetic answer, that it pleased him to take them by the road
chosen. He is careful, however, to assign (11.6-8) an adequate reason
for his preference.<br>

of Tweeddale, and a little farther up the stream, which descends from
the hills of Lammermoor, are the remains of the old castle of the family.&rsquo;-LOCKHART.<br>
<br>
Many hold that Gifford and not Gifford-gate, at the outskirts of Haddington,
was the birthplace of John Knox.<br>
<br>
<b>Stanza II. line 31</b>. An ivy-bush or garland was a tavern sign,
and the flagon is an appropriate accompaniment. Chaucer&rsquo;s Sompnour
(Prol. 666) suggested the tavern sign by his head-gear:-<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;A garland hadde he set upon his
heed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As gret as it were for an <i>ale-stake</i>.&rsquo;<br>

(and note) in same series:-&rsquo;If it be true that good wine needs
no bush,&rsquo; &amp;c.<br>
<br>
<b>line 33</b>. &lsquo;The accommodations of a Scottish hostelrie, or
inn, in the sixteenth century, may be collected from Dunbar&rsquo;s
admirable tale of &ldquo;The Friars of Berwick.&rdquo; Simon Lawder,
&ldquo;the gay ostlier,&rdquo; seems to have lived very comfortably;
and his wife decorated her person with a scarlet kirtle, and a belt
of silk and silver, and rings upon her fingers; and feasted her paramour
with rabbits, capons, partridges, and Bourdeaux wine. At least, if the
Scottish inns were not good, it was not from want of encouragement from
the legislature; who, so early as the reign of James I, not only enacted,
that in all boroughs and fairs there be hostellaries, having stables
and chambers, and provision for man and horse, but by another statute,
ordained that no man, travelling on horse or foot, should presume to
lodge anywhere except in these hostellaries; and that no person, save
innkeepers, should receive such travellers, under the penalty of forty
shillings, for exercising such hospitality. But, in spite of these provident
enactments, the Scottish hostels are but indifferent, and strangers
continue to find reception in the houses of individuals.&rsquo;-SCOTT.<br>
<br>
It is important to supplement this note by saying that the most competent
judges still doubt whether Dunbar wrote &lsquo;The Friars of Berwick.&rsquo;
It is printed among his doubtful works.<br>
<br>
<b>Stanza III</b>. Such a kitchen as that described was common in Scotland
till recent times, and relics of a similar interior exist in remote
parts still. The wide chimney, projecting well into the floor, formed
a capacious tunnel to the roof, and numerous sitters could be accommodated
with comfort in front and around the fire. Smoke and soot from the wood
and peat fuel were abundant, and the &lsquo;winter cheer,&rsquo;-hams,
venison, &amp;c.-hung from the uncovered rafters, were well begrimed
before coming to the table.<br>
<br>
<b>line 48</b>. The solan goose frequents Scottish haunts in summer.
There are thousands of them on Ailsa Craig, in the Frith of Clyde, and

of a leg&rsquo;), the buttock or thigh of a hog salted and dried; the
lower end of a flitch.<br>
<br>
<b>Stanza IV. line 73</b>. &lsquo;The winds of March&rsquo; (Winter&rsquo;s
Tale, iv. 3. 120), are a prominent feature of the month. The <i>freshness</i>
of May has fascinated the poets since it was told by Chaucer (Knightes&rsquo;
Tale, 175) how Emelie arose one fine morning in early summer:-<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Emilie, that fairer was to scene<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than is the lilie on hire stalke
grene,<br>

<br>
<b>line 78. buxom</b> (A. S. <i>bocsum</i>, flexible, obedient, from

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Bardolph, a soldier firm and sound
of heart,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And of <i>buxom</i> valour.<br>

A familiar instance of &lsquo;speed&rsquo; as a trans. verb is in Pope&rsquo;s
Odyssey, XV. 83:-&rsquo;Welcome the coming, speed the parting guest.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<b>Stanza VIII. line 120</b>. St. Valentine&rsquo;s day is Feb. 14,
when birds pair and lovers (till at any rate recent times) exchange
artistic tokens of affection. The latter observance is sadly degenerated.
See Professor Skeat&rsquo;s note to &lsquo;Parlement of Foules,&rsquo;
line 309, in Chaucer&rsquo;s Minor Poems (Clarendon Press).<br>
<br>
<b>line 122</b>. The myth of Philomela has been a favourite with English
sentimental poets. The Elizabethan Barnefield writes the typical lyric
on the theme. These lines contain the myth :--<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;She, poor bird, as all forlorn,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lean&rsquo;d her breast against
a thorn,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there sung the dolefullest ditty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That to hear it was great pity.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<b>Stanza IX</b>. In days when harvesting was done with the sickle,
reapers from the Highlands and from Ireland came in large numbers to
the Scottish Lowlands and cut the crops. At one time a piper played
characteristic melodies behind the reapers to give them spirit for their
work. Hence comes-<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Wha will gar our shearers shear?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wha will bind up the brags of weir?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
in a lyric by Hamilton of Gilbertfield (1665-1751). The reaper&rsquo;s
song is the later representative of this practice. See Wordsworth&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Solitary Highland Reaper&rsquo;-immortalized by her suggestive
and memorable singing-and compare the pathetic &lsquo;Exile&rsquo;s
Song&rsquo; of Robert Gilfillan (1798-1850):-<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Oh! here no Sabbath bell<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awakes the Sabbath morn;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor song of reapers heard<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the yellow corn.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
For references to Susquehanna and the home-longing of the exile, see
Campbell&rsquo;s &lsquo;Gertrude of Wyoming,&rsquo; I. i.-vi. The introduction
of reaping-machines has minimised the music and poetry of the harvest
field.<br>
<br>
<b>Stanzas X, XI</b>. The two pictures in the song are very effectively
contrasted both in spirit and style.&nbsp; The lover&rsquo;s resting-place
has features that recall the house of Morpheus, &lsquo;Faery Queene,&rsquo;
I. i. 40-1. Note the recurrence of the traitor&rsquo;s doom in Marmion&rsquo;s
troubled thoughts, in VI. xxxii. The burden <i>&lsquo;eleu loro&rsquo;</i>
has been somewhat uncertainly connected with the Italian <i>ela loro</i>,
&lsquo;alas! for them.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<b>Stanza XIII. lines 201-7</b>. One of the most striking illustrations
of this is in Shakespeare&rsquo;s delineation of Brutus, who is himself
made to say (Julius Caesar, ii. I. 18):-<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;The abuse of greatness is, when
it disjoins<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remorse from power.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
For the sentiment of the text cp. the character of Ordonio in Coleridge&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Remorse,&rsquo; the concentrated force of whose dying words is
terrible, while indicative of native nobility:-<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;I stood in silence like a slave
before her<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I might taste the wormwood
and the gall,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And satiate this self-accusing heart<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With bitterer agonies than death
can give.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<b>line 211</b>. &lsquo;Among other omens to which faithful credit is
given among the Scottish peasantry, is what is called the &ldquo;dead-bell,&rdquo;

<b>line 325</b>. Alexander III (1240-1286) came to the throne at the
age of nine, and proved himself a vigorous and large-hearted king. He
was killed by a fall from his horse, near Kinghorn, Fife, where there
is a suitable monument to his memory. The contemporary lament for his
death bewails him as one that &lsquo;Scotland led in love and lee.&rsquo;
Sir Walter Scott (Introductory Remarks to &lsquo;Border Minstrelsy&rsquo;)
calls him &lsquo;the last Scottish king of the pure Celtic race.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<b>line 333</b>. &lsquo;A vaulted hall under the ancient castle of Gifford,
or Yester (for it bears either name indifferently), the construction
of which has, from a very remote period, been ascribed to magic. The
Statistical Account of the Parish of Garvald and Baro, gives the following
account of the present state of this castle and apartment:-&rdquo;Upon
a peninsula, formed by the water of Hopes on the east, and a large rivulet
on the west, stands the ancient castle of Yester. Sir David Dalrymple,
in his annals, relates that &lsquo;Hugh Gifford de Yester died in 1267;
that in his castle there was a capacious cavern, formed by magical art,
and called in the country Bo-Hall, i.e. Hobgoblin Hall.&rsquo;&nbsp;
A stair of twenty-four steps led down to this apartment, which is a
large and spacious hall, with an arched roof; and though it hath stood
for so many centuries, and been exposed to the external air for a period
of fifty or sixty years, it is still as firm and entire as if it had
only stood a few years. From the floor of this hall, another stair of
thirty-six steps leads down to a pit which hath a communication with
Hopes-water. A great part of the walls of this large and ancient castle
are still standing. There is a tradition that the castle of Yester was
the last fortification, in this country, that surrendered to General
Gray, sent into Scotland by Protector Somerset.&rdquo;-<i>Statistical
Account</i>, vol. xiii. I have only to add, that, in 1737, the Goblin
Hall was tenanted by the Marquis of Tweedale&rsquo;s falconer, as I
learn from a poem by Boyse, entitled &ldquo;Retirement,&rdquo; written
upon visiting Yester.&nbsp; It is now rendered inaccessible by the fall
of the stair.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Sir David Dalrymple&rsquo;s authority for the anecdote is in
Fordun, whose words are:-&rdquo;A. D. MCCLXVII. <i>Hugo Giffard de Yester
moritur; cujus castrum, vel saltem caveam, et donglonem, arte daemonica
antique relationes ferunt fabrifactas: nam ibidem habetur mirabilis
specus subterraneus, opere mirifico constructus, magno terrarum spatio
protelatus, qui communiter BO-HALL appellatus est.</i>&rdquo; Lib. x.
cap. 21.-Sir David conjectures, that Hugh de Gifford must either have
been a very wise man, or a great oppressor.&rsquo;-SCOTT.<br>
<br>
<b>Stanza XX. line 354</b>. &lsquo;In 1263, Haco, King of Norway, came
into the Frith of Clyde with a powerful armament, and made a descent
at Largs, in Ayrshire. Here he was encountered and defeated, on the
2nd October, by Alexander III. Haco retreated to Orkney, where he died
soon after this disgrace to his arms. There are still existing, near
the place of battle, many barrows, some of which, having been opened,
were found, as usual, to contain bones and urns.&rsquo;-SCOTT.<br>
<br>
<b>line 358</b>. Ayrshire in early times comprised three divisions,
Cunninghame in the north, Kyle between the Irvine and the Doon, and
Carrick to the south of that stream. Burns, by his song &lsquo;There
was a Lad was born in Kyle,&rsquo; has immortalised the middle division,
which an old proverb had distinguished as productive of men, in contradistinction
to the dairy produce and the stock of the other two.<br>
<br>
<b>line 362</b>. &lsquo;&ldquo;Magicians, as is well known, were very
curious in the choice and form of their vestments. Their caps are oval,
or like pyramids, with lappets on each side, and fur within. Their gowns
are long, and furred with fox-skins, under which they have a linen garment
reaching to the knee. Their girdles are three inches broad, and have
many cabalistical names, with crosses, trines, and circles inscribed
on them. Their shoes should be of new russet leather, with a cross cut
upon them. Their knives are dagger-fashion; and their swords have neither
guard nor scabbard.&rdquo;-See these, and many other particulars, in
the Discourse concerning Devils and Spirits, annexed to REGINALD SCOTT&rsquo;S
<i>Discovery of Witchcraft</i>, edition 1665.&rsquo;-SCOTT.<br>

&lsquo;A pentacle is a piece of fine linen, folded with five corners,
according to the five senses, and suitably inscribed with characters.
This the magician extends towards the spirits which he invokes, when
they are stubborn and rebellious, and refuse to be conformable unto
the ceremonies and rights of magic.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<b>line 373</b>. The term &lsquo;Combust&rsquo; is applied to the moon
or the planets, when, through being not more than eight and a half degrees
from the sun, they are invisible in his light. Chaucer, in the &lsquo;Astrolabe,&rsquo;
has &lsquo;that he be not retrograd ne <i>combust</i>.&rsquo; &lsquo;Retrograde&rsquo;
is&nbsp; the term descriptive of the motion of the planets from east
to west. This is the case when the planets are visible on the side opposite
to the sun. See Airy&rsquo;s &lsquo;Popular Astronomy,&rsquo; p. 124.
&lsquo;Trine&rsquo; refers to the appearance of planets &lsquo;distant
from each other 120&deg;, or the third part of the zodiac. &lsquo;Trine
was considered a favourable conjunction. Cp. note on Par. Lost, X. 659,

<b>line 503</b>. Scott quotes thus from the essay on &lsquo;Fairy Superstitions&rsquo;
in the &lsquo;Border Minstrelsy,&rsquo; vol. ii., to show &lsquo;whence
many of the particulars of the combat between Alexander III and the
Goblin Knight are derived&rsquo;:-<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Gervase of Tilbury (<i>Otia Imperial ap. Script, rer. Brunsvic</i>,
vol. i. p. 797), relates the following popular story concerning a fairy
knight: &ldquo;Osbert, a bold and powerful baron, visited a noble family
in the vicinity of Wandlebury, in the bishopric of Ely. Among other
stories related in the social circle of his friends, who, according
to custom, amused each other by repeating ancient tales and traditions,
he was informed, that if any knight, unattended, entered an adjacent
plain by moonlight, and challenged an adversary to appear, he would
be immediately encountered by a spirit in the form of a knight. Osbert
resolved to make the experiment, and set out, attended by a single squire,
whom he ordered to remain without the limits of the plain, which was
surrounded by an ancient intrenchment. On repeating the challenge, he
was instantly assailed by an adversary, whom he quickly unhorsed, and
seized the reins of his steed. Daring this operation, his ghostly opponent
sprung up, and darting his spear, like a javelin, at Osbert, wounded
him in the thigh. Osbert returned in triumph with the horse, which he
committed to the care of his servants. The horse was of a sable colour,
as well as his whole accoutrements, and apparently of great beauty and
vigour. He remained with his keeper till cock-crowing, when, with eyes
flashing fire, he reared, spurned the ground, and vanished. On disarming
himself, Osbert perceived that he was wounded, and that one of his steel
boots was full of blood.&rdquo; Gervase adds, that, &ldquo;as long as
he lived, the scar of his wound opened afresh on the anniversary of
the eve on which he encountered the spirit.&rdquo; Less fortunate was
the gallant Bohemian knight, who travelling by night with a single companion,
&ldquo;came in sight of a fairy host, arrayed under displayed banners.
Despising the remonstrances of his friend, the knight pricked forward
to break a lance with a champion, who advanced from the ranks apparently
in defiance. His companion beheld the Bohemian overthrown, horse and
man, by his aerial adversary; and returning to the spot next morning,
he found the mangled corpses of the knight and steed.&rdquo;-<i>Hierarchy
of Blessed Angels</i>, p. 554.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Besides these instances of Elfin chivalry above quoted, many
others might be alleged in support of employing fairy machinery in this
manner. The forest of Glenmore, in the North Highlands, is believed
to be haunted by a spirit called <i>Lham-dearg</i>, in the array of
an ancient warrior, having a bloody hand, from which he takes his name.
He insists upon those with whom he meets doing battle with him; and
the clergyman, who makes up an account of the district, extant in the
Macfarlane MS., in the Advocates&rsquo; Library, gravely assures us,
that, in his time, <i>Lham-dearg</i> fought with three brothers whom
he met in his walk, none of whom long survived the ghostly conflict.
Barclay, in his &ldquo;Euphormion,&rdquo; gives a singular account of
an officer who had ventured, with his servant, rather to intrude upon
a haunted house, in a town in Flanders, than to put up with worse quarters
elsewhere. After taking the usual precautions of providing fires, lights,
and arms, they watched till midnight, when, behold! the severed arm
of a man dropped from the ceiling; this was followed by the legs, the
other arm, the trunk, and the head of the body, all separately. The
members rolled together, united themselves in the presence of the astonished
soldiers, and formed a gigantic warrior, who defied them both to combat.
Their blows, although they penetrated the body, and amputated the limbs,
of their strange antagonist, had, as the reader may easily believe,
little effect on an enemy who possessed such powers of self-union; nor
did his efforts make more effectual impression upon them. How the combat
terminated I do not exactly remember, and have not the book by me; but
I think the spirit made to the intruders on his mansion the usual proposal,
that they should renounce their redemption; which being declined, he
was obliged to retreat.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;The most singular tale of this kind is contained in an extract
communicated to me by my friend Mr. Surtees of Mainsforth, in the Bishopric,
who copied it from a MS. note in a copy of Burthogge&nbsp; &ldquo;On
the Nature of Spirits,&rdquo; 8vo, 1694, which had been the property
of the late Mr. Gill, attorney-general to Egerton, Bishop of Durham.
&ldquo;It was not,&rdquo; says my obliging correspondent&rdquo; in Mr.
Gill&rsquo;s own hand, but probably an hundred years older, and was
said to be, <i>E libro Convent. Dunelm. per T. C. extract</i>., whom
I believe to have been Thomas Cradocke, Esq., barrister, who held several
offices under the See of Durham a hundred years ago. Mr. Gill was possessed
of most of his manuscripts.&rdquo; The extract, which, in fact, suggested
the introduction of the tale into the present poem, runs thus:-<br>
<br>
<i>&ldquo;Rem miram hujusmodi que nostris temporibus evenit, teste viro

<b>INTRODUCTION TO CANTO FOURTH</b>.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;James Skene, Esq., of Rubislaw, Aberdeenshire, was Cornet in
the Royal Edinburgh Light Horse Volunteers; and Sir Walter Scott was
Quartermaster of the same corps.&rsquo;-LOCKHART.<br>
<br>
For Skene&rsquo;s account of the origin of this regiment, due in large
measure to &lsquo;Scott&rsquo;s ardour,&rsquo; see &lsquo;Life of Scott,&rsquo;
i. 258.<br>
<br>
<b>line 2</b>. See Taming of the Shrew, i. 4. 135, and 2 Henry IV, v.
3. 143, where a line of an old song is quoted:-<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Where is the life that late I led?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<b>line 3</b>. See As you Like It, ii. 7. 12.<br>
<br>
<b>line 7</b>. Scott made the acquaintance of Skene, recently returned
from a lengthened stay in Saxony, about the end of 1796, and profited
much by his friend&rsquo;s German knowledge and his German books. In
later days he utilized suggestions of Skene&rsquo;s in &lsquo;Ivanhoe&rsquo;
and &lsquo;Quentin Durward.&rsquo; See &lsquo;Life of Scott,&rsquo;
<i>passim</i>, and specially i. 257, and iv. 342.<br>

<b>line 37. Blackhouse</b>, a farm &lsquo;situated on the Douglas-burn,
then tenanted by a remarkable family, to which I have already made allusion-that

a hill in the south of Selkirkshire.<br>
<br>
<b>line 46</b>. &lsquo;Various illustrations of the Poetry and Novels
of Sir Walter Scott, from designs by Mr. Skene, have since been published.&rsquo;-LOCKHART.<br>
<br>
<b>line 48</b>. Probably the first reference in poetry to the Scottish
heather is, says Prof. Veitch (&lsquo;Feeling for Nature,&rsquo; ii.
52), in Thomson&rsquo;s &lsquo;Spring,&rsquo; where the bees are represented
as daring<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;The purple heath, or where the
wild thyme grows.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<b>lines 55-97</b>. With this striking typical winter piece, cp. in
Thomson&rsquo;s &lsquo;Winter,&rsquo; the vivid and pathetic picture
beginning:--<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;In his own loose-revolving fields,
the swain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disastered stands.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
See also Burns&rsquo;s &lsquo;Winter Night,&rsquo; which by these lines
may have suggested Scott&rsquo;s &lsquo;beamless sun&rsquo;:-<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;When Phoebus gies a short-liv&rsquo;d
glow&rsquo;r<br>

<br>
The &lsquo;tired ploughman,&rsquo; too, may owe something to this farther
line of Burns:-<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Poor labour sweet in sleep was
lock&rsquo;d&rsquo;;<br>
<br>
while the animals seeking shelter may well follow this inimitable and

<b>line 91</b>. &lsquo;I cannot help here mentioning that, on the night
on which these lines were written, suggested as they were by a sudden
fall of snow, beginning after sunset, an unfortunate man perished exactly
in the manner here described, and his body was next morning found close
to his own house. The accident happened within five miles of the farm
of Ashestiel.&rsquo;-SCOTT.<br>
<br>
<b>line 101</b>. &lsquo;The Scottish Harvest-home.&rsquo;-SCOTT. Perhaps
the name &lsquo;kirn&rsquo; is due to the fact that a churnful of cream
is a feature of the night&rsquo;s entertainment. In Chambers&rsquo;s
Burns, iii. 151, Robert Ainslie gives an account of a kirn at Ellisland
in 1790.<br>

his friends, as well as in the general respect and esteem of Scotland
at large. His &ldquo;Life of Beattie,&rdquo; whom he befriended and
patronised in life, as well as celebrated after his decease, was not
long published, before the benevolent and affectionate biographer was
called to follow the subject of his narrative. This melancholy event
very shortly succeeded the marriage of the friend, to whom this introduction
is addressed, with one of Sir William&rsquo;s daughters.&rsquo;-SCOTT.<br>

friend from boyhood, and he received his copy of &lsquo;Marmion&rsquo;
at Lympstone, where he was, owing to feeble health, as mentioned in
the text. He was a son-in-law of Sir William Forbes, and in acknowledging
receipt of the poem he said, &lsquo;I must thank you for the elegant

This personage is a strolling demon or <i>esprit follet</i>, who, once

an avowed Protestant reformer. He was concerned about the existing wrongs
both of Church and State, and thought of rectifying these without revolutionary
measures.<br>

the shield, at a fixed distance from the border. As to the fleur-de-lis
(flower of the lily, emblem of France) Scott quotes Boethius and Buchanan
as saying that it was &lsquo;first assumed by Achaius, king of Scotland,
contemporary of Charlemagne, and founder of, the celebrated League with
France.&rsquo; Historical evidence, however, would seem to show that
&lsquo;the lion is first seen on the seal of Alexander II, and the tressure
on that of Alexander III.&rsquo; This is the heraldic description of
the arms of Scotland: &lsquo;Or, a lion rampant gules, armed and langued
azure, within a double tressure flory counterflory of <i>fleur-de-lis</i>
of the second.&rsquo; The supporters are &lsquo;two unicorns argent
maned and unguled, or gorged with open crowns.&rsquo; The crest is &lsquo;a
lion sejant affronte gules crowned or,&rsquo; &amp;c. The adoption of
the thistle as the national Scottish emblem is wrapt in obscurity, although
an early poet attributes it to a suggestion of Venus.<br>
<br>
<b>line 153</b>. Scott mentions Chalmers&rsquo;s edition of Lyndsay&rsquo;s
works, published in 1806. More recent and very satisfactory editions
are those of Dr. David Laing, (1) a library edition in three volumes,
and (2) a popular edition in two. Lyndsay was born about 1490 and died
about 1555. The Mount was his estate, near Cupar-Fife. &lsquo;I am uncertain,&rsquo;
says Scott, &lsquo;if I abuse poetic license, by introducing Sir David
Lindesay in the character of Lion-Herald, sixteen years before he obtained
that office. At any rate, I am not the first who has been guilty of
that anachronism; for the author of &ldquo;Flodden Field&rdquo; despatches
<i>Dallamount</i>, which can mean nobody but Sir David de la Mont, to
France on the message of defiance from James IV to Henry VIII. It was
often an office imposed on the Lion King-at-arms, to receive foreign
ambassadors; and Lindesay himself did this honour to Sir Ralph Sadler,
in 1539-40. Indeed, the oath of the Lion, in its first article, bears
reference to his frequent employment upon royal messages and embassies.
The office of heralds, in feudal times, being held of the utmost importance,
the inauguration of the Kings-at-arms, who presided over their colleges,
was proportionally solemn. In fact, it was the mimicry of a royal coronation,
except that the unction was made with wine instead of oil. In Scotland,
a namesake and kinsman of Sir David Lindesay, inaugurated in 1502, &ldquo;was
crowned by King James with the ancient crown of Scotland, which was
used before the Scottish Kings assumed a close Crown;&rdquo; and, on
occasion of the same solemnity, dined at the King&rsquo;s table, wearing
the crown. It is probable that the coronation of his predecessor was
not less solemn. So sacred was the herald&rsquo;s office, that, in 1515,
Lord Drummond was by Parliament declared guilty of treason, and his
lands forfeited, because he had struck, with his fist, the Lion King-at-arms,
when he reproved him for his follies. Nor was he restored, but at the
Lion&rsquo;s earnest solicitation.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<b>Stanza X. line 194</b>. &lsquo;A large ruinous castle on the banks
of the Tyne, about ten miles from Edinburgh. As indicated in the text,
it was built at different times, and with a very differing regard to
splendour and accommodation. The oldest part of the building is a narrow
keep, or tower, such as formed the mansion of a lesser Scottish baron;
but so many additions have been made to it, that there is now a large
courtyard, surrounded by buildings of different ages. The eastern front
of the court is raised above a portico, and decorated with entablatures,
bearing anchors. All the stones of this front are cut into diamond facets,
the angular projections of which have an uncommonly rich appearance.
The inside of this part of the building appears to have contained a
gallery of great length, and uncommon elegance. Access was given to
it by a magnificent stair-case, now quite destroyed. The soffits are
ornamented with twining cordage and rosettes: and the whole seems to
have been far more splendid than was usual in Scottish castles. The
castle belonged originally to the Chancellor, Sir William Crichton,
and probably owed to him its first enlargement, as well as its being
taken by the Earl of Douglas, who imputed to Crichton&rsquo;s counsels
the death of his predecessor, Earl William, beheaded in Edinburgh Castle,
with his brother, in 1440. It is said to have been totally demolished
on that occasion; but the present state of the ruin shows the contrary.
In 1483 it was garrisoned by Lord Crichton, then its proprietor, against
King James III, whose displeasure he had incurred by seducing his sister
Margaret, in revenge, it is said, for the Monarch having dishonoured
his bed. From the Crichton family the castle passed to that of the Hepburns,
Earls Bothwell; and when the forfeitures of Stewart, the last Earl Bothwell,
were divided, the barony and cattle of Crichton fell to the share of
the Earl of Buccleuch. They were afterwards the property of the Pringles
of Clifton, and are now that of Sir John Callander, Baronet. It were
to be wished the proprietor would take a little pains to preserve those
splendid remains of antiquity, which are at present used as a fold for
sheep, and wintering cattle; although, perhaps, there are very few ruins
in Scotland which display so well the style and beauty of castle-architecture.&rsquo;-SCOTT.<br>
<br>
The ruin is now carefully protected, visitors being admitted on application
at Crichtoun Manse adjoining.<br>
<br>
<b>Stanza XI. line 232</b>. &lsquo;The castle of Crichton has a dungeon
vault, called the <i>Massy More</i>. The epithet, which is not uncommonly
applied to the prisons of other old castles in Scotland, is of Saracenic
origin. It occurs twice in the <i>&ldquo;Epistolae Itineriae&rdquo;</i>
of Tollius. <i>&ldquo;Carcer subterraneus, sive, ut Mauri appellant,
MAZMORRA,&rdquo;</i> p. 147; and again, <i>&ldquo;Coguntur omnes Captivi
sub noctem in ergastula subterranea, quae Turcae Algezerani vocant MAZMORRAS,&rdquo;</i>
p. 243. The same word applies to the dungeons of the ancient Moorish
castles in Spain, and serves to show from what nation the Gothic style
of castle building was originally derived.&rsquo;-SCOTT.<br>

<b>Stanza XIV. line 280</b>. Scott quotes from Lindsay of Pitscottie
the story of the apparition seen at Linlithgow by James IV, when undergoing
his annual penance for having taken the field against his father. Some
of the younger men about the Court had devised what they felt might
be an impressive warning to the King against going to war, and their
show of supernatural interference was well managed. Lindsay&rsquo;s
narrative proceeds thus:-<br>
<br>
&lsquo;The King came to Lithgow, where he happened to be for the time
at the Council, very sad and dolorous, making his devotion to God, to
send him good chance and fortune in his voyage. In this meantime, there
came a man, clad in a blue gown, in at the kirk door, and belted about
him in a roll of linen-cloth; a pair of brotikings1 on his feet, to
the great of his legs; with all other hose and clothes conform thereto;
but he had nothing on his head, but syde2 red yellow hair behind, and
on his haffets3, which wan down to his shoulders; but his forehead was
bald and bare. He seemed to be a man of two-and-fifty years, with a
great pike-staff in his hand, and came first forward among the lords,
crying and speiring4 for the King, saying, he desired to speak with
him. While, at the last, he came where the King was sitting in the desk,
at his prayers, but when he saw the King, he made him little reverence
or salutation, but leaned down groffling on the desk before him, and
said to him in this manner, as after follows: &ldquo;Sir King, my mother
hath sent me to you, desiring you not to pass, at this time, where thou
art purposed; for if thou does, thou wilt not fare well in thy journey,
nor none that passeth with thee. Further, she bade thee mell5 with no
woman, nor use their counsel, nor let them touch thy body, nor thou
theirs; for, if thou do it, thou wilt be confounded and brought to shame.&rdquo;<br>

<br>
&lsquo;By this man had spoken thir words unto the King&rsquo;s grace,
the evening-song was near done, and the King paused on thir words, studying
to give him an answer; but, in the meantime, before the King&rsquo;s
eyes, and in the presence of all the lords that were about him for the
time, this man vanished away, and could no ways be seen nor comprehended,
but vanished away as he had been a blink of the sun, or a whip of the
whirlwind, and could no more be seen. I heard say. Sir David Lindesay,
Lyon-herauld, and John Inglis the marshal, who were, at that time, young
men, and special servants to the King&rsquo;s grace, were standing presently
beside the King, who thought to have laid hands on this man, that they
might have speired further tidings at him: But all for nought; they
could not touch him; for he vanished away betwixt them, and was no more
seen.&rsquo;<br>
Buchanan, in more elegant, though not more impressive language, tells
the same story, and quotes the personal information of our Sir David
Lindesay: <i>&lsquo;In iis, (i.e. qui propius astiterant) fuit David
Lindesius, Montanus, homo spectatae fidei et probitatis, nec a literarum
studiis alienus, et cujus totius vitae tenor longissime a mentiendo
aberat; a quo nisi ego haec uti tradidi, pro certis accepissem, ut vulgatam
vanis rumoribus fabulam omissurus eram</i>.&rdquo;-Lib. xiii. The King&rsquo;s
throne, in St. Catherine&rsquo;s aisle, which he had constructed for
himself, with twelve stalls for the Knights Companions of the Order
of the Thistle, is still shown as the place where the apparition was
seen. I know not by what means St. Andrew got the credit of having been
the celebrated monitor of James IV; for the expression in Lindesay&rsquo;s
narrative, &ldquo;My mother has sent me,&rdquo; could only be used by
St. John, the adopted son of the Virgin Mary. The whole story is so
well attested, that we have only the choice between a miracle or an
imposture. Mr. Pinkerton plausibly argues, from the caution against
incontinence, that the Queen was privy to the scheme of those who had
recourse to this expedient, to deter King James from his impolitic war.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<b>Stanza XV. line 287</b>. &lsquo;In Scotland there are about twenty
palaces, castles, and remains, or sites of such,<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Where <i>Scotia&rsquo;s</i> kings
of other years&rdquo;<br>
<br>
had their royal home.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Linlithgow, distinguished by the combined strength and beauty
of its situation, must have been early selected as a royal residence.
David, who bought the title of saint by his liberality to the Church,
refers several of his charters to his town of Linlithgow; and in that
of Holyrood expressly bestows on the new monastery all the skins of
the rams, ewes, and lambs, belonging to his castle of Linlitcu, which
shall die during the year....The convenience afforded for the sport
of falconry, which was so great a favourite during the feudal ages,
was probably one cause of the attachment of the ancient Scottish monarchs
to Linlithgow and its fine lake. The sport of hunting was also followed
with success in the neighbourhood, from which circumstance it probably
arises that the ancient arms of the city represent a black greyhound
bitch tied to a tree....The situation of Linlithgow Palace is eminently
beautiful. It stands on a promontory of some elevation, which advances
almost into the midst of the lake. The form is that of a square court,
composed of buildings of four storeys high, with towers at the angles.
The fronts with the square, and the windows, are highly ornamented,
and the size of the rooms, as well as the width and character of the
staircases, are upon a magnificent scale. One banquet-room is ninety-four
feet long, thirty feet wide, and thirty-three feet high, with a gallery
for music. The King&rsquo;s wardrobe, or dressing-room, looking to the
west, projects over the walls, so as to have a delicious prospect on
three aides, and is one of the most enviable boudoirs we have ever seen.&rsquo;-SIR

silvan sound conveyed great delight to our ancestors, chiefly, I suppose,
from association. A gentle knight in the reign of Henry VIII, Sir Thomas

<b>Stanza XXV. line 521</b>. &lsquo;The Borough, or Common Moor of Edinburgh,
was of very great extent, reaching from the southern walls of the city
to the bottom of Braid Hills. It was anciently a forest; and, in that
state, was so great a nuisance, that the inhabitants of Edinburgh had
permission granted to them of building wooden galleries, projecting
over the street, in order to encourage them to consume the timber; which
they seem to have done very effectually. When James IV mustered the
array of the kingdom there, in 1513, the Borough-moor was, according
to Hawthornden, &ldquo;a field spacious, and delightful by the shade
of many stately and aged oaks.&rdquo; Upon that, and similar occasions,
the royal standard is traditionally said to have been displayed from
the Hare Stane, a high stone, now built into the wall, on the left hand
of the highway leading towards Braid, not far from the head of Bruntsfield

&lsquo;As they had no pavilions, or round houses, of any commendable
compass, so wear there few other tentes with posts, as the used manner
of making is; and of these few also, none of above twenty foot length,
but most far under; for the most part all very sumptuously beset, (after
their fashion,) for the love of France, with fleur-de-lys, some of blue
buckeram, some of black, and some of some other colours. These white
ridges, as I call them, that, as we stood on Fauxsyde Bray, did make
so great muster toward us, which I did take then to be a number of tentes,
when we came, we found it a linen drapery, of the coarser cambryk in
dede, for it was all of canvas sheets, and wear the tenticles, or rather
cabyns and couches of their soldiers; the which (much after the common
building of their country beside) had they framed of four sticks, about
an ell long a piece, whereof two fastened together at one end aloft,
and the two endes beneath stuck in the ground, an ell asunder, standing
in fashion like the bowes of a sowes yoke; over two such bowes (one,
as it were, at their head, the other at their feet), they stretched
a sheet down on both sides, whereby their cabin became roofed like a
ridge, but skant shut at both ends, and not very close beneath on the
sides, unless their sticks were the shorter, or their wives the more
liberal to lend them larger napery; howbeit, when they had lined them,
and stuff&rsquo;d them so thick with straw, with the weather as it was
not very cold, when they wear ones couched, they were as warm as they
had been wrapt in horses dung.&rsquo;-PATTEN&rsquo;S <i>Account of Somerset&rsquo;s

<br>
&lsquo;GEORGE ELLIS, to whom this Introduction is addressed, is &ldquo;the
well-known coadjutor of Mr. Canning and Mr. Frere in the &ldquo;Anti-Jacobin,&rdquo;
and editor of &ldquo;Specimens of Ancient English Romances,&rdquo; &amp;c.
He died 10th April, 1815, aged 70 years; being succeeded in his estates
by his brother, Charles Ellis, Esq., created in 1827 Lord Seaford.&rsquo;-LOCKHART.

<b>line 37</b>. &lsquo;The Old Town of Edinburgh was secured on the
north side by a lake, now drained, and on the south by a wall, which
there was some attempt to make defensible even so late as 1745. The
gates, and the greater part of the wall, have been pulled down, in the
course of the late extensive and beautiful enlargement of the city.
My ingenious and valued friend, Mr. Thomas Campbell, proposed to celebrate
Edinburgh under the epithet here borrowed. But the &ldquo;Queen of the
North&rdquo; has not been so fortunate as to receive from so eminent
a pen the proposed distinction.&rsquo;-SCOTT.<br>
<br>
<b>line 57</b>. &lsquo;Since writing this line, I find I have inadvertently
borrowed it almost verbatim, though with somewhat a different meaning,
from a chorus in &ldquo;Caractacus&rdquo;:-<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She flung her white arms o&rsquo;er

<b>line 118</b>. &lsquo;Henry VI, with his Queen, his heir, and the
chiefs of his family, fled to Scotland after the battle of Towton. In
this note a doubt was formerly expressed whether Henry VI came to Edinburgh,
though his Queen certainly did; Mr. Pinkerton inclining to believe that
he remained at Kirkcudbright. But my noble friend, Lord Napier, has
pointed out to me a grant by Henry, of an annuity of forty marks to
his Lordship&rsquo;s ancestor, John Napier, subscribed by the King himself,
<i>at Edinburgh</i>, the 28th day of August, in the thirtyninth year
of his reign, which corresponds to the year of God, 1461. This grant,
Douglas, with his usual neglect of accuracy, dates in 1368. But this
error being corrected from the copy of Macfarlane&rsquo;s MSS., p. 119,
to, removes all scepticism on the subject of Henry VI being really at
Edinburgh. John Napier was son and heir of Sir Alexander Napier, and
about this time was Provost of Edinburgh. The hospitable reception of
the distressed monarch and his family, called forth on Scotland the
encomium of Molinet, a contemporary poet. The English people, he says,-<br>

<b>line 120</b>. &lsquo;In January, 1796, the exiled Count d&rsquo;Artois,
afterwards Charles X of France, took up his residence in Holyrood, where
he remained until August, 1799. When again driven from his country,
by the revolution of July, 1830, the same unfortunate Prince, with all
the immediate members of his family, sought refuge once more in the
ancient palace of the Stuarts, and remained there until 18th September,
1833.&rsquo;-LOCKHART.<br>
<br>
<b>line 140</b>. &lsquo;Mr. Ellis, in his valuable Introduction to the
&ldquo;Specimens of Romance,&rdquo; has proved, by the concurring testimony
of La Ravaillere, Tressan, but especially the Abbe de la Rue, that the
courts of our Anglo-Norman Kings, rather than those of the French monarch,
produced the birth of Romance literature. Marie, soon after mentioned,
compiled from Armorican originals, and translated into Norman-French,
or Romance language, the twelve curious Lays of which Mr. Ellis has
given us a <i>precis</i> in the Appendix to his Introduction. The story
of Blondel, the famous and faithful minstrel of Richard I, needs no

<br>
<b>Stanza I. line 18</b>. &lsquo;This is no poetical exaggeration. In
some of the counties of England, distinguished for archery, shafts of
this extraordinary length were actually used. Thus, at the battle of
Blackheath, between the troops of Henry VII and the Cornish insurgents,
in 1496, the bridge of Dartford was defended by a picked band of archers
from the rebel army, &ldquo;whose arrows,&rdquo; says Holinshed, &ldquo;were
in length a full cloth yard.&rdquo; The Scottish, according to Ascham,
had a proverb, that every English archer carried under his belt twenty-four
Scots, in allusion to his bundle of unerring shafts.&rsquo;-SCOTT.<br>
<br>
<b>Stanza II. line 32. croupe</b> = (1) the buttocks of the horse, as
in Chaucer&rsquo;s &lsquo;Fryars Tale,&rsquo; line 7141, &lsquo;thakketh
his horse upon the croupe&rsquo;; (2) the place behind the saddle, as
here and in &lsquo;Young Lochinvar,&rsquo; below, 351.<br>
<br>
<b>line 33</b>. &lsquo;The most useful <i>air</i>, as the Frenchmen
term it, <i>is territerr</i>, the <i>courbettes</i>, <i>cabrioles</i>,
or <i>un pas et un sault</i>, being fitter for horses of parade and
triumph than for soldiers: yet I cannot deny but a <i>demivolte</i>
with <i>courbettes</i>, so that they be not too high, may be useful
in a fight or <i>meslee</i>; for, as Labroue hath it, in his Book of
Horsemanship, Monsieur de Montmorency having a horse that was excellent
in performing the <i>demivolte</i>, did, with his sword, strike down
two adversaries from their horses in a tourney, where divers of the
prime gallants of France did meet; for, taking his time, when the horse
was in the height of his <i>courbette</i>, and discharging a blow then,
his sword fell with such weight and force upon the two cavaliers, one
after another, that he struck them from their horses to the ground.&rsquo;-<i>Lord
Herbert of Cherbury&rsquo;s Life</i>, p. 48.-SCOTT.<br>
<br>
<b>line 35</b>. &lsquo;The Scottish burgesses were, like yeomen, appointed
to be armed with bows and sheaves, sword, buckler, knife, spear, or
a good axe instead of a bow, if worth L100: their armour to be of white
or bright harness. They wore <i>white hats</i>, i.e. bright steel caps,
without crest or visor. By an act of James IV their <i>weapon-schawings</i>
are appointed to be held four times a year, under the aldermen or bailiffs.&rsquo;-SCOTT.<br>
<br>
<b>lines 40-48</b>. Corslet, a light cuirass protecting the front of
the body; <b>brigantine</b>, a jacket quilted with iron (also spelt
&lsquo;brigandine&rsquo;); <b>gorget</b>, a metal covering for the throat;
<b>mace</b>, a heavy club, plain or spiked, designed to bruise armour.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Bows and quivers were in vain recommended to the peasantry of
Scotland, by repeated statutes; spears and axes seem universally to
have been used instead of them. The defensive armour was the plate-jack,
hauberk, or brigantine; and their missile weapons crossbows and culverins.
All wore swords of excellent temper, according to Patten; and a voluminous
handkerchief round their neck, &ldquo;not for cold, but for cutting.&rdquo;
The mace also was much used in the Scottish army! The old poem on the
battle of Flodden mentions a band-<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Who manfully did meet their foes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With leaden mauls, and lances long.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;When the feudal array of the kingdom was called forth, each man
was obliged to appear with forty days&rsquo; provision. When this was
expended, which took place before the battle of Flodden, the army melted
away of course. Almost all the Scottish forces, except a few knights,
men-at-arms, and the Border-prickers, who formed excellent light-cavalry,
acted upon foot.&rsquo;-SCOTT.<br>

not to Sir John Falstaff alone that such an introductory preface was
necessary, however well judged and acceptable on the part of Mr. Brook;
for Sir Ralph Sadler, while on an embassy to Scotland in 1539-40, mentions,
with complacency, &lsquo;the same night came Rothesay (the herald so

<b>Stanza VIII</b>. The admirable characterisation, by which in this

individually delineated and vividly contrasted, deserves special attention.
There is every reason to believe that the delineations, besides being

<br>

<br>
<b>line 221. A baldric</b> (remotely from Lat. balteus, a girdle) was
an ornamental belt passing over one shoulder and round the other side,
and having the sword suspended from it. Cp. Pope&rsquo;s Iliad, III.
415:-<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;A radiant <i>baldric</i>, o&rsquo;er
his shoulder tied,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sustained the sword that glittered
at his side.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
See also the &lsquo;wolf-skin baldric&rsquo; in &lsquo;Lay of the Last
Minstrel,&rsquo; III. xvi.<br>
<br>
<b>Stanza IX. line 249</b>. &lsquo;Few readers need to be reminded of
this belt, to the weight of which James added certain ounces every year
that he lived. Pitscottie founds his belief that James was not slain
in the battle of Flodden, because the English never had this token of
the iron-belt to show to any Scottishman. The person and character of
James are delineated according to our best historians. His romantic
disposition, which led him highly to relish gaiety, approaching to license,
was, at the same time, tinged with enthusiastic devotion. These propensities
sometimes formed a strange contrast. He was wont, during his fits of
devotion, to assume the dress, and conform to the rules, of the order
of Franciscans; and when he had thus done penance for some time in Stirling,
to plunge again into the tide of pleasure. Probably, too, with no unusual
inconsistency, he sometimes laughed at the superstitions observances
to which he at other times subjected himself. There is a very singular
poem by Dunbar, seemingly addressed to James IV, on one of these occasions
of monastic seclusion. It is a most daring and profane parody on the
services of the Church of Rome, entitled:-<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<i>Dunbar&rsquo;s

<br>
See the whole in Sibbald&rsquo;s Collection, vol. i. p. 234.&rsquo;-SCOTT.<br>

Since Scott&rsquo;s time Dunbar&rsquo;s poems have been edited, with
perfect scholarship and skill, by David Laing (2 vols. post 8vo. 1824),
and by John Small (in l885) for the Scottish Text Society. See Dict.

<br>
<b>lines 254-9</b>. This perfect description may be compared, for accuracy
of observation and dexterous presentment, with the steed in &lsquo;Venus
and Adonis,&rsquo; the paragon of horses in English verse. Both writers
give ample evidence of direct personal knowledge.<br>
<br>
<b>Stanza X. line 261</b>. &lsquo;It has been already noticed [see note
to stanza xiii. of Canto I.] that King James&rsquo;s acquaintance with
Lady Heron of Ford did not commence until he marched into England. Our
historians impute to the King&rsquo;s infatuated passion the delays
which led to the fatal defeat of Flodden. The author of &ldquo;The Genealogy
of the Heron Family&rdquo; endeavours, with laudable anxiety, to clear
the Lady Ford from this scandal; that she came and went, however, between
the armies of James and Surrey, is certain. See PINKERTON&rsquo;S <i>History</i>,
and the authorities he refers to, vol. ii. p. 99. Heron of Ford had
been, in 1511, in some sort accessory to the slaughter of Sir Robert
Kerr of Cessford, Warden of the Middle Marches. It was committed by
his brother the bastard, Lilburn, and Starked, three Borderers. Lilburn
and Heron of Ford were delivered up by Henry to James, and were imprisoned
in the fortress of Fastcastle, where the former died. Part of the pretence
of Lady Ford&rsquo;s negotiations with James was the liberty of her
husband.&rsquo;-SCOTT.<br>
<br>
<b>line 271. love</b> = beloved. Cp. Burns&rsquo;s &lsquo;O my love
is like a red red rose.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<b>line 273</b>. &lsquo;&ldquo;Also the Queen of France wrote a love-letter
to the King of Scotland, calling him her love, showing him that she
had suffered much rebuke in France for the defending of his honour.
She believed surely that he would recompense her again with some of
his kingly support in her necessity; that is to say, that he would raise
her an army, and come three foot of ground on English ground, for her
sake. To that effect she sent him a ring off her finger, with fourteen
thousand French crowns to pay bis expenses.&rdquo; PITSCOTTIE, p.110.-A

and dagger, preserved in the College of Heralds, London.&rsquo;-SCOTT.<br>

has the intended effect of arresting the attention and lending pathos
to the description and sentiment.<br>

a family of seamen, to whom James IV granted letters of reprisal against
Portuguese traders for the violent death of their father. Both the King
and the Bartons profited much by their successes. At length the Earl
of Surrey, accusing Andrew Barton of attacking English as well as Portuguese
vessels, sent two powerful men-of-war against him, and a sharp battle,
fought in the Downs, resulted in Barton&rsquo;s death and the capture
of his vessels. See Chambers&rsquo;s &lsquo;Eminent Scotsmen,&rsquo;

<br>
<b>line 386</b>. James sent his herald to Henry before Terouenne, calling
upon him to desist from hostilities against Scotland&rsquo;s ally, the
king of France, and sternly reminding him of the various insults to
which Henry&rsquo;s supercilious policy had subjected him. Flodden had
been fought before the messenger returned with his answer. Barclay a
contemporary poet, had written about seven years earlier, in his &lsquo;Ship
of Fooles&rsquo;:-<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;If the Englishe Lion his wisedome

But such a desirable consummation was to wait yet a while.<br>
<br>
<b>Stanza XIV. line 398</b>. &lsquo;Archibald Douglas, Earl of Angus,&rsquo;
says Scott, &lsquo;a man remarkable for strength of body and mind, acquired
the popular name of <i>Bell-the-Cat</i>, upon the following remarkable
occasion:-James the Third, of whom Pitscottie complains that he delighted
more in music, and &ldquo;policies of building,&rdquo; than in hunting,
hawking, and other noble exercises, was so ill advised as to make favourites
of his architects and musicians, whom the same historian irreverently
terms masons and fiddlers. His nobility, who did not sympathise in the
King&rsquo;s respect for the fine arts, were extremely incensed at the
honours conferred on those persons, particularly on Cochrane, a mason,
who had been created Earl of Mar; and, seizing the opportunity, when,
in 1482, the King had convoked the whole array of the country to march
against the English, they held a midnight council in the church of Lauder,
for the purpose of forcibly removing these minions from the King&rsquo;s
person. When all had agreed on the propriety of this measure, Lord Gray
told the assembly the apologue of the Mice, who had formed a resolution,
that it would be highly advantageous to their community to tie a bell
round the cat&rsquo;s neck, that they might hear her approach at a distance;
but which public measure unfortunately miscarried, from no mouse being
willing to undertake the task of fastening the bell. &ldquo;I understand
the moral,&rdquo; said Angus, &ldquo;and, that what we propose may not
lack execution, I will <i>bell the cat</i>.&rdquo;&lsquo;<br>
<br>
The rest of the strange scene is thus told by Pitscottie:-<br>
<br>
&lsquo;By this was advised and spoken by thir lords foresaid, Cochran,
the Earl of Mar, came from the King to the council, (which council was
holden in the kirk of Lauder for the time,) who was well accompanied
with a band of men of war; to the number of three hundred light axes,
all clad in white livery, and black bends thereon, that they might be
known for Cochran the Earl of Mar&rsquo;s men. Himself was clad in a
riding-pie of black velvet, with a great chain of gold about his neck,
to the value of five hundred crowns, and four blowing horns, with both
the ends of gold and silk, set with a precious stone, called a berryl,
hanging in the midst. This Cochran had his heumont born before him,
overgilt with gold, and so were all the rest of his horns, and all his
pallions were of fine canvas of silk, and the cords thereof fine twined
silk, and the chains upon his pallions were double overgilt with gold.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;This Cochran was so proud in his conceit, that he counted no
lords to be marrows to him, therefore he rushed rudely at the kirk-door.
The council inquired who it was that perturbed them at that time. Sir
Robert Douglas, Laird of Lochleven, was keeper of the kirk-door at that
time, who inquired who that was that knocked so rudely; and Cochran
answered, &ldquo;This is I, the Earl of Mar.&rdquo; The which news pleased
well the lords, because they were ready boun to cause take him, as is
before rehearsed. Then the Earl of Angus past hastily to the door, and
with him Sir Robert Douglas of Lochleven, there to receive in the Earl
of Mar, and go many of his complices who were there, as they thought
good. And the Earl of Angus met with the Earl of Mar, as he came in
at the door, and pulled the golden chain from his craig, and said to
him, a tow1 would set him better. Sir Robert Douglas syne pulled the
blowing horn from him in like manner, and said, &ldquo;He had been the
hunter of mischief over long.&rdquo; This Cochran asked, &ldquo;My lords,
is it mows2, or earnest?&rdquo; They answered, and said, &ldquo;It is
good earnest, and so thou shalt find; for thou and thy complices have
abused our prince this long time; of whom thou shalt hare no more credence,
but shalt have thy reward according to thy good service, as thou hast
deserved in times bypast; right so the rest of thy followers.&rdquo;<br>

&lsquo;Notwithstanding, the lords held them quiet till they caused certain
armed men to pass into the King&rsquo;s pallion, and two or three wise
men to pass with them, and give the King fair pleasant words, till they
laid hands on all the King&rsquo;s servants and took them and hanged
them before his eyes over the bridge of Lawder. Incontinent they brought
forth Cochran, and his hands bound with a tow, who desired them to take
one of his own pallion tows and bind his hands, for he thought shame
to have his hands bound with such tow of hemp, like a thief. The lords
answered, he was a traitor, he deserved no better; and, for despight,
they took a hair tether3, and hanged him over the bridge of Lawder,
above the rest of his complices.&rsquo;-PITSCOTTIE, p. 78, folio edit.<br>

was resolved upon. He earnestly spoke against that measure from its
commencement; and, on the eve of the battle of Flodden, remonstrated
so freely upon the impolicy of fighting, that the King said to him,
with scorn and indignation, &ldquo;if he was afraid, he might go home.&rdquo;
The Earl burst into tears at this insupportable insult, and retired
accordingly, leaving his sons, George, Master of Angus, and Sir William
of Glenbervie, to command his followers. They were both slain in the
battle, with two hundred gentlemen of the name of Douglas. The aged
Earl, broken-hearted at the calamities of his house and his country,
retired into a religious house, where he died about a year after the
field of Flodden.&rsquo;-SCOTT.<br>

<b>line 429</b>. &lsquo;The ruins of Tantallon Castle occupy a high
rock projecting into the German Ocean, about two miles east of North
Berwick. The building is not seen till a close approach, as there is
rising ground betwixt it and the land. The circuit is of large extent,
fenced upon three sides by the precipice which overhangs the sea, and
on the fourth by a double ditch and very strong outworks. Tantallon
was a principal castle of the Douglas family, and when the Earl of Angus
was banished, in 1527, it continued to hold out against James V. The
King went in person against it, and for its reduction, borrowed from
the Castle of Dunbar, then belonging to the Duke of Albany, two great
cannons, whose names, as Pitscottie informs us with laudable minuteness,
were &ldquo;Thrawn mouth&rsquo;d Meg and her Marrow&rdquo;; also, &ldquo;two
great botcards, and two moyan, two double falcons, and four quarter
falcons&rdquo;; for the safe guiding and re-delivery of which, three
lords were laid in pawn at Dunbar. Yet, notwithstanding all this apparatus,
James was forced to raise the siege, and only afterwards obtained possession
of Tantallon by treaty with the governor, Simon Panango, When the Earl
of Angus returned from banishment, upon the death of James, he again
obtained possession of Tantallon, and it actually afforded refuge to
an English ambassador, under circumstances similar to those described
in the text. This was no other than the celebrated Sir Ralph Sadler,
who resided there for some time under Angus&rsquo;s protection, after
the failure of his negotiation for matching the infant Mary with Edward
VI. He says, that though this place was poorly furnished, it was of
such strength as might warrant him against the malice of his enemies,
and that he now thought himself out of danger. (His State papers were
published in 1810, with certain notes by Scott.)<br>
<br>
&lsquo;There is a military tradition, that the old Scottish March was
meant to express the words,<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Ding down Tantallon,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mak a brig to the Bass.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Tantallon was at length &ldquo;dung down&rdquo; and ruined by
the Covenanters; its lord, the Marquis of Douglas, being a favourer
of the royal cause. The castle and barony were sold in the beginning
of the eighteenth century to President Dalrymple of North Berwick, by
the then Marquis of Douglas.&rsquo;-SCOTT.<br>
<br>
In 1888, under the direction of Mr. Walter Dalrymple, son of the proprietor,
certain closed staircases in the ruins were opened, and various excavations
were made, with the purpose of discovering as fully as possible what
the original character of the structure had been. These operations have
added greatly to the interest of the ruin, which both by position and
aspect is one of the most imposing in the country.<br>
<br>
<b>line 432</b>. &lsquo;A very ancient sword, in possession of Lord
Douglas, bears, among a great deal of flourishing, two hands pointing
to a heart which is placed betwixt them, and the date 1329, being the
year in which Bruce charged the Good Lord Douglas to carry his heart
to the Holy Land. The following lines (the first couplet of which is
quoted by Godscroft, as a popular saying in his time) are inscribed
around the emblem:-<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So mony guid as of ye Dovglas beinge,<br>

&lsquo;This curious and valuable relic was nearly lost during the Civil
War of 1745-6, being carried away from Douglas Castle by some of those
in arms for Prince Charles. But great interest having been made by the
Duke of Douglas among the chief partisans of the Stuart, it was at length
restored. It resembles a Highland claymore, of the usual size, is of
an excellent temper, and admirably poised.&rsquo;-SCOTT.<br>

obliged to believe in the divine judgment being enunciated in the trial
by duel, to find salvos for the strange and obviously precarious chances
of the combat. Various curious evasive shifts, used by those who took
up an unrighteous quarrel, were supposed sufficient to convert it into
a just one. Thus, in the romance of &ldquo;Amys and Amelion,&rdquo;
the one brother-in-arms, fighting for the other, disguised in his armour,
swears that <i>he</i> did not commit the crime of which the Steward,
his antagonist, truly, though maliciously, accused him whom he represented.
Brantome tells a story of an Italian, who entered the lists upon an
unjust quarrel, but, to make his cause good, fled from his enemy at
the first onset. &ldquo;Turn, coward!&rdquo; exclaimed his antagonist.

and in this quarrel will I fight to the death, but my first cause of
combat was unjust, and I abandon it.&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Je vous laisse

of victory: <i>&ldquo;Un autre abus y avoit-il, que ceux qui avoient

<b>line 717</b>. &lsquo;The Cross of Edinburgh was an ancient and curious
structure. The lower part was an octagonal tower, sixteen feet in diameter,
and about fifteen feet high. At each angle there was a pillar, and between
them an arch, of the Grecian shape. Above these was a projecting battlement,
with a turret at each corner, and medallions, of rude but curious workmanship,
between them. Above this rose the proper Cross, a column of one stone,
upwards of twenty feet high, surmounted with a unicorn. This pillar
is preserved in the grounds of the property of Drum, near Edinburgh.
The Magistrates of Edinburgh, in 1756, with consent of the Lords of
Session, (<i>proh pudor!</i>) destroyed this curious monument, under
a wanton pretext that it encumbered the street; while, on the one hand,
they left an ugly mass called the Luckenbooths, and, on the other, an
awkward, long, and low guard-house, which were fifty times more encumbrance
than the venerable and inoffensive Cross.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;From the tower of the Cross, so long as it remained, the heralds
published the acts of Parliament; and its site, marked by radii, diverging
from a stone centre, in the High Street, is still the place where proclamations
are made.&rsquo;-SCOTT.<br>
<br>
See Fergusson&rsquo;s &lsquo;Plainstanes,&rsquo; Poems, p. 48. The Cross
was restored by Mr. Gladstone in 1885, to commemorate his connexion
with Midlothian as its parliamentary representative.<br>

<b>line 735</b>. &lsquo;This supernatural citation is mentioned by all

an attempt, by those averse to the war, to impose upon the superstitious
temper of James IV. The following account from Pitscottie is characteristically
minute, and furnishes, besides, some curious particulars of the equipment
of the army of James IV. I need only add to it, that Plotcock, or Plutock,
is no other than Pluto. The Christians of the middle ages by no means
disbelieved in the existence of the heathen deities; they only considered
them as devils, and Plotcock, so far from implying any thing fabulous,
was a synonyme of the grand enemy of mankind.&rdquo; <a name="citation2"></a><a href="#footnote2">{2}</a>&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yet all thir warnings, and uncouth tidings, nor no good counsel,
might stop the King, at this present, from his vain purpose, and wicked
enterprize, but hasted him fast to Edinburgh, and there to make his
provision and famishing, in having forth of his army against the day
appointed, that they should meet in the Barrow-muir of Edinburgh: That
is to say, seven cannons that he had forth of the Castle of Edinburgh,
which were called the Seven Sisters, casten by Robert Borthwick, the
master-gunner, with other small artillery, bullet, powder, and all manner
of order, as the master-gunner could devise.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;&ldquo;In this meantime, when they were taking forth their artillery,
and the King being in the Abbey for the time, there was a cry heard
at the Market-cross of Edinburgh at the hour of midnight, proclaiming
as it had been a summons, which was named and called by the proclaimer
thereof, the summons of Plotcock; which desired all men to compear,
both Earl, and Lord, and Baron, and all honest gentlemen within the
town, (every man specified by his own name,) to compear, within the
space of forty days, before his master, where it should happen him to
appoint, and be for the time, under the pain of disobedience. But whether
this summons was proclaimed by vain persons, night-walkers, or drunken
men, for their pastime, or if it was a spirit, I cannot tell truly:
but it was shewn to me, that an indweller of the town, Mr. Richard Lawson,
being evil disposed, ganging in his gallery-stair foreanent the Cross,
hearing this voice proclaiming this summons, thought marvel what it
should be, cried on his servant to bring him his purse; and when he
had brought him it, he took out a crown, and cast over the stair, saying,
&lsquo;I appeal from that summons, judgment, and sentence thereof, and
take me all whole in the mercy of God, and Christ Jesus his son.&rsquo;
Verily, the author of this, that caused me write the manner of this
summons, was a landed gentleman, who was at that time twenty years of
age, and was in the town the time of the said summons; and thereafter,
when the field was stricken, he swore to me, there was no man that escaped
that was called in this summons, but that one man alone which made his
protestation, and appealed from the said summons: but all the lave were
perished in the field with the king.&rdquo;&lsquo;<br>

This Baron, having expelled the monks from the church of Coventry, was
not long of experiencing the divine judgment, as the same monks, no
doubt, termed his disaster. Having waged a feudal war with the Earl
of Chester, Marmion&rsquo;s horse fell, as he charged in the van of
his troop, against a body of the Earl&rsquo;s followers: the rider&rsquo;s

into Tantallon, as she had into Dunbar and Inchkeith,&nbsp; in order
the better to bridle the lords and barons, who inclined to the reformed
faith, and to secure by citadels the sea-coast of the Frith of Forth.
For this purpose, the Regent, to use the phrase of the time &ldquo;dealed
with&rdquo; the (then) Earl of Angus for his consent to the proposed
measure. He occupied himself, while she was speaking, in feeding a falcon
which sat upon his wrist, and only replied by addressing the bird, but
leaving the Queen to make the application. &ldquo;The devil is in this
greedy gled-she will never be fou.&rdquo; But when the Queen, without
appearing to notice this hint, continued to press her obnoxious request,
Angus replied, in the true spirit of a feudal noble, &ldquo;Yes, Madam,
the castle is yours; God forbid else. But by the might of God, Madam!&rdquo;
such was his usual oath, &ldquo;I must be your Captain and Keeper for
you, and I will keep it as well as any you can place there.&rsquo;&ldquo;SIR

Richard Heber (1773-1833) half-brother of Bishop Heber, was for some
time M. P. for Oxford University. His large inherited fortune enabled
him freely to indulge his love of books, and his, English library of
105,000 volumes cost him L180,000. He had thousands besides on the continent.
As a cherished friend of Scott&rsquo;s he is frequently mentioned in
the &lsquo;Life.&rsquo; He introduced Leyden to Scott (Life, i. 333,

of the Danes at table displayed itself in pelting each other with bones,
and Torfaeus tells a long and curious story, in the History of Hrolfe
Kraka, of one Hottus, an inmate of the Court of Denmark, who was so
generally assailed with these missiles, that he constructed, out of
the bones with which he was overwhelmed, a very respectable intrenchment,
against those who continued the raillery. The dances of the northern
warriors round the great fires of pine-trees, are commemorated by Olaus
Magnus, who says, they danced with such fury, holding each other by
the hands, that, if the grasp of any failed, he was pitched into the
fire with the velocity of a sling. The sufferer, on such occasions,
was instantly plucked out, and obliged to quaff off a certain measure
of ale, as a penalty for &ldquo;spoiling the king&rsquo;s fire.&rdquo;&lsquo;SCOTT.<br>

who (in Northumberland at least) used to go about in disguise to the
neighbouring houses, bearing the then useless ploughshares; and the
<i>Guisards </i>of Scotland, not yet in total disuse, present, in some
indistinct degree, a shadow of the old mysteries, which were the origin
of the English drama. In Scotland, (<i>me ipso teste</i>,) we were wont,
during my boyhood, to take the characters of the apostles, at least
of Peter, Paul, and Judas Iscariot; the first had the keys, the second
carried a sword, and the last the bag, in which the dole of our neighbours&rsquo;
plum-cake was deposited. One played as a champion, and recited some
traditional rhymes; another was:-<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;....&ldquo;Alexander,
King of Macedon,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who conquer&rsquo;d all the world
but Scotland alone.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he came to Scotland his courage
grew cold,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see a little nation courageous
and bold.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
These, and many such verses, were repeated, but by rote, and unconnectedly.
There were also, occasionally, I believe, a Saint George. In all, there
was a confused resemblance of the ancient mysteries, in which the characters
of Scripture, the Nine Worthies, and other popular personages, were
usually exhibited. It were much to be wished that the Chester Mysteries
were published from the MS. in the Museum, with the annotations which
a diligent investigator of popular antiquities might still supply. The
late acute and valuable antiquary, Mr. Ritson, showed me several memoranda
towards such a task, which are probably now dispersed or lost. See,
however, his &ldquo;Remarks on Shakspeare,&rdquo; 1783, p. 38.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Since the first edition of &ldquo;Marmion&rdquo; appeared, this
subject has received much elucidation from the learned and extensive
labours of Mr. Douce; and the Chester Mysteries (edited by J. H. Markland,
Esq.) have been printed in a style of great elegance and accuracy (in

&lsquo;The venerable old gentleman, to whom the lines are addressed
was the younger brother of William Scott of Raeburn. Being the cadet
of a cadet of the Harden family, he had very little to lose; yet he
contrived to lose the small property he had, by engaging in the civil
wars and intrigues of the house of Stuart. His veneration for the exiled
family was so great, that he swore he would not shave his beard till
they were restored: a mark of attachment, which, I suppose, had been
common during Cromwell&rsquo;s usurpation; for, in Cowley&rsquo;s &ldquo;Cutter
of Coleman Street,&rdquo; one drunken cavalier upbraids another, that,
when he was not able to afford to pay a barber, he affected to &ldquo;wear
a beard for the King.&rdquo; I sincerely hope this was not absolutely
the original reason of my ancestor&rsquo;s beard; which, as appears
from a portrait in the possession of Sir Henry Hay Macdougal, Bart.,
and another painted for the famous Dr. Pitcairn, was a beard of a most
dignified and venerable appearance.&rsquo;- SCOTT.<br>

tale, by the Reverend George Warrington, who says:-<br>
<br>
&lsquo;&ldquo;The event, on which the tale is founded, is preserved
by tradition in the family of the Vaughans of Hengwyrt; nor is it entirely
lost, even among the common people, who still point out this oak to
the passenger. The enmity between the two Welsh chieftains, Howel Sele,
and Owen Glendwr, was extreme, and marked by vile treachery in the one,
and ferocious cruelty in the other. <a name="citation3"></a><a href="#footnote3">{3}</a>&nbsp;
The story is somewhat changed and softened, as more favourable to the
character of the two chiefs, and as better answering the purpose of
poetry, by admitting the passion of pity, and a greater degree of sentiment
in the description. Some trace of Howel Sele&rsquo;s mansion was to
be seen a few years ago, and may perhaps be still visible, in the park
of Nannau, now belonging to Sir Robert Vaughan, Baronet, in the wild
and romantic tracks of Merionethshire. The abbey mentioned passes under
two names, Vener and Cymmer. The former is retained, as more generally
used.&rdquo;-See the Metrical Tale in Sir<br>

<b>line 163</b>. <i>&lsquo;The Daoine shi</i>,&rsquo; or <i>Men of Peace</i>,
of the Scottish Highlanders, rather resemble the Scandinavian <i>Duergar</i>,
than the English Fairies. Notwithstanding their name, they are, if not
absolutely malevolent, at least peevish, discontented, and apt to do
mischief on slight provocation. The belief of their existence is deeply
impressed on the Highlanders, who think they are particularly offended
at mortals, who talk of them, who wear their favourite colour green,
or in any respect interfere with their affairs. This is especially to
be avoided on Friday, when, whether as dedicated to Venus, with whom,
in Germany, this subterraneous people are held nearly connected, or
for a more solemn reason, they are more active and possessed of greater
power. Some curious particulars concerning the popular superstitions
of the Highlanders may be found in Dr. Graham&rsquo;s Picturesque Sketches
of Perthshire.&rsquo;-SCOTT.<br>

<b>Friday</b> (the day of the goddess Freya) is regarded as lucky for
marriages. Mr. Thiselton Dyer in &lsquo;Domestic Folk-lore,&rsquo; p.
39, quotes the City Chamberlain of Glasgow as affirming that &lsquo;nine-tenths
of the marriages in Glasgow are celebrated on a Friday.&rsquo; In Hungary
nothing of any importance is undertaken on a Friday, and there is a
Hungarian proverb which says that &lsquo;whoever is merry on a Friday
is sure to weep on the Sunday.&rsquo; The Sicilians make the exception
for weddings. In America Friday is a lucky daythe New World, no doubt,
upsetting in this as other matters the conservatism of the Old. The
superstition of sailors about Friday is famous. Cp. the old English
song &lsquo;The Mermaid.&rsquo; For further discussion of the subject

<b>line 175</b>. &lsquo;The journal of the Friend, to whom the Fourth
Canto of the poem is inscribed, furnished me with the following account
of a striking superstition:-<br>
<br>
&lsquo;&ldquo;Passed the pretty little village of Franchemont (near
Spaw), with the romantic ruins of the old castle of the counts of that
name. The road leads through many delightful vales, on a rising ground:
at the extremity of one of them stands the ancient castle, now the subject
of many superstitions legends. It is firmly believed by the neighbouring
peasantry, that the last Baron of Franchemont deposited, in one of the
vaults of the castle, a ponderous chest, containing an immense treasure
in gold and silver, which, by some magic spell, was intrusted to the
care of the Devil, who is constantly found sitting on the chest in the
shape of a huntsman. Any one adventurous enough to touch the chest is
instantly seized with the palsy. Upon one occasion, a priest of noted
piety was brought to the vault: he used all the arts of exorcism to
persuade his infernal majesty to vacate his seat, but in vain; the huntsman
remained immovable. At last, moved by the earnestness of the priest,
he told him, that he would agree to resign the chest, if the exorciser
would sign his name with blood. But the priest understood his meaning,
and refused, as by that act he would have delivered over his soul to
the Devil. Yet if any body can discover the mystic words used by the
person who deposited the treasure, and pronounced them, the fiend must
instantly decamp. I had many stories of a similar nature from a peasant,
who had himself seen the Devil, in the shape of a great cat.&rdquo;&lsquo;-SCOTT.<br>

or Whitby, where she so long resided. At a particular time of the year
(viz. in the summer months), at ten or eleven in the forenoon, the sunbeams
fall in the inside of the northern part of the choir; and &lsquo;tis
then that the spectators, who stand on the west side of Whitby churchyard,
so as just to see the most northerly part of the abbey pass the north
end of Whitby church, imagine they perceive, in one of the highest windows
there, the resemblance of a woman, arrayed in a shroud. Though we are
certain this is only a reflection caused by the splendour of the sunbeams,
yet fame reports it, and it is constantly believed among the vulgar,
to be an appearance of Lady Hilda in her shroud, or rather in a glorified
state; before which, I make no doubt, the Papists, even in these our

of four stanzas entitled &lsquo;Conscience.&rsquo; To each book of the
&lsquo;AEneid,&rsquo; however, as well as to the supplementary thirteenth
book of Maphaeus Vegius, which he also translates, he prefixes an introductory
poem, so that there is a sense in which it is correct to call him the
author of &lsquo;many pieces.&rsquo; His works were first published

him on the spot. But ere he could obtain James&rsquo;s pardon for this
slaughter, Angus was obliged to yield his castle of Hermitage, in exchange
for that of Bothwell, which was some diminution to the family greatness.
The sword with which he struck so remarkable a blow, was presented by
his descendant, James Earl of Morton, afterwards Regent of Scotland,

and of the Earl of Angus in particular.&rsquo; See note to Clarendon
Press &lsquo;Lay of Last Minstrel,&rsquo; VI. 469.<br>
<br>
<b>line 437</b>. &lsquo;This ebullition of violence in the potent Earl
of Angus is not without its example in the real history of the house
of Douglas, whose chieftains possessed the ferocity, with the heroic
virtues, of a savage state. The most curious instance occurred in the
case of Maclellan, Tutor of Bombay, who, having refused to acknowledge
the pre-eminence claimed by Douglas over the gentlemen and Barons of
Galloway, was seized and imprisoned by the Earl, in his castle of the
Thrieve, on the borders of Kirkcudbrightshire. Sir Patrick Gray, commander
of King James the Second&rsquo;s guard, was uncle to the Tutor of Bombay,
and obtained from the King a &ldquo;sweet letter of supplication,&rdquo;
praying the Earl to deliver his prisoner into Gray&rsquo;s hand. When
Sir Patrick arrived at the castle, he was received with all the honour
due to a favourite servant of the King&rsquo;s household; but while
he was at dinner, the Earl, who suspected his errand, caused his prisoner
to be led forth and beheaded. After dinner, Sir Patrick presented the
King&rsquo;s letter to the Earl, who received it with great affectation
of reverence; &ldquo;and took him by the hand, and led him forth to
the green, where the gentleman was lying dead, and showed him the manner,
and said, &lsquo;Sir Patrick, you are come a little too late; yonder
is your sister&rsquo;s son lying, but he wants the head; take his body,
and do with it what you will.&rsquo;-Sir Patrick answered again with
a sore heart, and said, &lsquo;My lord, if ye have taken from him his
head, dispone upon the body as ye please;&rsquo; and with that called
for his horse, and leaped thereon; and when he was on horseback, he
said to the Earl on this manner: &lsquo;My Lord, if I live, you shall
be rewarded for your labours, that you have used at this time, according
to your demerits.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;&ldquo;At this saying the Earl was highly offended, and cried
for horse. Sir Patrick, seeing the Earl&rsquo;s fury, spurred his horse,
but he was chased near Edinburgh ere they left him; and had it not been
his led horse was so tried and good, he had been taken.&rdquo;&lsquo;-PITSCOTTIE&rsquo;S

<b>Stanza XIX line 573</b>, &lsquo;On the evening previous to the memorable
battle of Flodden, Surrey&rsquo;s headquarters were at Barmoor Wood,
and King James held an inaccessible position on the ridge of Flodden-hill,
one of the last and lowest eminences detached from the ridge of Cheviot.
The Till, a deep and slow river, winded between the armies. On the morning
of the 9th September, 1513, Surrey marched in a north-westerly direction,
and crossed the Till, with his van and artillery, at Twisel Bridge,
nigh where that river joins the Tweed, his rear-guard column passing
about a mile higher, by a ford. This movement had the double effect
of placing his army between King James and his supplies from Scotland,
and of striking the Scottish monarch with surprise, as he seems to have
relied on the depth of the river in his front. But as the passage, both
over the bridge and through the ford, was difficult and slow, it seems
possible that the English might have been attacked to great advantage
while straggling with these natural obstacles. I know not if we are
to impute James&rsquo;s forbearance to want of military skill, or to
the romantic declaration which Pitscottie puts in his mouth, &ldquo;that
he was determined to have his enemies before him on a plain field,&rdquo;
and therefore would suffer no interruption to be given, even by artillery,
to their passing the river.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;The ancient bridge of Twisel, by which the English crossed the
Till, is still standing beneath Twisel Castle, a splendid pile of Gothic
architecture, as now rebuilt by Sir Francis Blake, Bart., whose extensive
plantations have so much improved the country around. The glen is romantic
and delightful, with steep banks on each side, covered with copse, particularly
with hawthorn.&nbsp; Beneath a tall rock, near the bridge, is a plentiful
fountain, called St. Helen&rsquo;s Well.&rsquo;-SCOTT.<br>
<br>
That James was credited by his contemporaries with military skill and
ample courage will be seen by reference to Barclay&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ship
of Fooles,&rsquo; formerly referred to. The poet proposes a grand general
European movement against the Turks, and suggests James IV as the military
leader.&nbsp; The following complimentary acrostic is a feature of the
passage:-<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;I n prudence pereles is this moste
comely kinge;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A nd as for his strength and magnanimitie<br>

in the appearance of the Till just below Twisel Bridge. No one contrasting

<b>Stanza XXIII. line 682</b>. &lsquo;The reader cannot here expect
a full account of the Battle of Flodden: but, so far as is necessary
to understand the romance, I beg to remind him, that, when the English
army, by their skilful countermarch, were fairly placed between King
James and his own country, the Scottish monarch resolved to fight; and,
setting fire to his tents, descended from the ridge of Flodden to secure
the neighbouring eminence of Brankstone, on which that village is built.
Thus the two armies met, almost without seeing each other, when, according
to the old poem of &ldquo;Flodden Field,&rdquo;-<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The English line stretch&rsquo;d
east and west,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And southward were their
faces set;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Scottish northward proudly prest,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And manfully their foes
they met.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The English army advanced in four divisions. On the right, which first
engaged, were the sons of Earl Surrey, namely, Thomas Howard, the Admiral
of England, and Sir Edmund, the Knight Marshal of the army. Their divisions
were separated from each other; but, at the request of Sir Edmund, his
brother&rsquo;s battalion was drawn very near to his own. The centre
was commanded by Surrey in person; the left wing by Sir Edward Stanley,
with the men of Lancashire, and of the palatinate of Chester. Lord Dacres,
with a large body of horse, formed a reserve. When the smoke, which
the wind had driven between the armies, was somewhat dispersed, they
perceived the Scots, who had moved down the hill in a similar order
of battle, and in deep silence. <a name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5">{5}</a>&nbsp;
The Earls of Huntley and of Home commanded their left wing, and charged
Sir Edmund Howard with such success as entirely to defeat his part of
the English right wing. Sir Edmund&rsquo;s banner was beaten down, and
he himself escaped with difficulty to his brother&rsquo;s division.
The Admiral, however, stood firm; and Dacre advancing to his support
with the reserve of cavalry, probably between the interval of the divisions
commanded by the brothers Howard, appears to have kept the victors in
effectual check. Home&rsquo;s men, chiefly Borderers, began to pillage
the baggage of both armies; and their leader is branded, by the Scottish
historians, with negligence or treachery. On the other hand, Huntley,
on whom they bestow many encomiums, is said, by the English historians,
to have left the field after the first charge. Meanwhile the Admiral,
whose flank these chiefs ought to have attacked, availed himself of
their inactivity, and pushed forward against another large division
of the Scottish army in his front, headed by the Earls of Crawford and
Montrose, both of whom were slain, and their forces routed. On the left,
the success of the English was yet more decisive; for the Scottish right
wing, consisting of undisciplined Highlanders, commanded by Lennox and
Argyle, was unable to sustain the charge of Sir Edward Stanley, and
especially the severe execution of the Lancashire archers. The King
and Surrey, who commanded the respective centres of their armies, were
meanwhile engaged in close and dubious conflict. James, surrounded by
the flower of his kingdom, and impatient of the galling discharge of
arrows, supported also by his reserve under Bothwell, charged with such
fury that the standard of Surrey was in danger. At that critical moment,
Stanley, who had routed the left wing of the Scottish, pursued his career
of victory, and arrived on the right flank, and in the rear of James&rsquo;s
division, which, throwing itself into a circle, disputed the battle
till night came on. Surrey then drew back his forces; for the Scottish
centre not having been broken, and the left wing being victorious, he
yet doubted the event of the field. The Scottish army, however, felt
their loss, and abandoned the field of battle in disorder, before dawn.
They lost, perhaps, from eight to ten thousand men; but that included
the very prime of their nobility, gentry, and even clergy.&nbsp; Scarce
a family of eminence but has an ancestor killed at Flodden; and there
is no province in Scotland, even at this day, where the battle is mentioned
without a sensation of terror and sorrow. The English also lost a great
number of men, perhaps within one-third of the vanquished, but they
were of inferior note.-See the only distinct detail of the Field of
Flodden in PINKERTON&rsquo;S <i>History</i>, Book xi; all former accounts
being full of blunders and inconsistency.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;The spot from which Clara views the battle, must be supposed
to have been on a hillock commanding the rear of the English right wing,
which was defeated, and in which conflict Marmion is supposed to have
fallen.&rsquo;-SCOTT.<br>
<br>
Lockhart adds this quotation:-&rsquo;In 1810, as Sir Carnaby Haggerstone&rsquo;s
workmen were digging in Flodden Field, they came to a pit filled with
human bones, and which seemed of great extent; but, alarmed at the sight,
they immediately filled up the excavation, and proceeded no farther.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;In 1817, Mr. Grey of Millfield Hill found, near the traces of
an ancient encampment, a short distance from Flodden Field, a tumulus,
which, on removing, exhibited a very singular sepulchre. In the centre,
a large urn was found, but in a thousand pieces. It had either been
broken to pieces by the stones falling upon it when digging, or had
gone to pieces on the admission of the air. This urn was surrounded
by a number of cells formed of flat stones, in the shape of graves,
but too small to hold the body in its natural state. These sepulchral
recesses contained nothing except ashes, or dust of the same kind as
that in the urn.&rdquo;-<i>Sykes&rsquo; Local Records</i> (2 vols. 8vo,
1833), vol. ii. pp. 60 and 109.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<b>Stanza XXIV. line 717</b>. &lsquo;Sir Brian Tunstall, called in the
romantic language of the time, Tunstall the Undefiled, was one of the
few Englishmen of rank slain at Flodden. He figures in the ancient English
poem, to which I may safely refer my readers, as an edition, with full
explanatory notes, has been published by my friend, Mr. Henry Weber.
Tunstall, perhaps, derived his epithet of undefiled from his white armour
and banner, the latter bearing a white cock, about to crow, as well
as from his unstained loyalty and knightly faith. His place of residence
was Thurland Castle.&rsquo;--SCOTT.<br>

<b>line 1059</b>. Lockhart here gives an extract from Jeffrey:-&lsquo;The
powerful poetry of these passages can receive no illustration from any
praise or observations of ours. It is superior, in our apprehension,
to all that this author has hitherto produced; and, with a few faults
of diction, equal to any thing that has ever been written upon similar
subjects. From the moment the author gets in sight of FIodden Field,
indeed, to the end of the poem, there is no tame writing, and no intervention
of ordinary passages. He does not once flag or grow tedious; and neither
stops to describe dresses and ceremonies, nor to commemorate the harsh
names of feudal barons from the Border. There is a flight of five or
six hundred lines, in short, in which he never stoops his wing, nor
wavers in his course; but carries the reader forward with a more rapid,
sustained, and lofty movement, than any epic bard that we can at present
remember.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<b>Stanza XXXV. 1. 1067</b>. Lockhart quotes from Byron&rsquo;s &lsquo;Lara&rsquo;
as a parallel,-<br>

<br>
<b>line 1084</b>. &lsquo;There can be no doubt that King James fell
in the battle of Flodden. He was killed, says the curious French Gazette,
within a lance&rsquo;s length of the Earl of Surrey; and the same account
adds, that none of his division were made prisoners, though many were
killed; a circumstance that testifies the desperation of their resistance.
The Scottish historians record many of the idle reports which passed
among the vulgar of their day. Home was accused, by the popular voice,
not only of failing to support the King, but even of having carried
him out of the field, and murdered him. And this tale was revived in
my remembrance, by an unauthenticated story of a skeleton, wrapped in
a bull&rsquo;s hide, and surrounded with an iron chain, said to have
been found in the well of Home Castle, for which, on enquiry, I could
never find any better authority than the sexton of the parish having
said, that, <i>if the well were cleaned out, he would not be surprised
at such a discovery</i>. Home was the chamberlain of the King, and his
prime favourite; he had much to lose (in fact did lose all) in consequence
of James&rsquo;s death, and nothing earthly to gain by that event: but
the retreat, or inactivity, of the left wing, which he commanded, after
defeating Sir Edmund Howard, and even the circumstance of his returning
unhurt, and loaded with spoil, from so fatal a conflict, rendered the
propagation of any calumny against him easy and acceptable. Other reports
gave a still more romantic turn to the King&rsquo;s fate, and averred,
that James, weary of greatness after the carnage among his nobles, had
gone on a pilgrimage, to merit absolution for the death of his father,
and the breach of his oath of amity to Henry. In particular, it was
objected to the English, that they could never show the token of the
iron belt; which, however, he was likely enough to have laid aside on
the day of battle, as encumbering his personal exertions. They produce
a better evidence, the monarch&rsquo;s sword and dagger, which are still
preserved in the Herald&rsquo;s College in London. Stowe has recorded
a degrading story of the disgrace with which the remains of the unfortunate
monarch were treated in his time. An unhewn column marks the spot where
James fell, still called the King&rsquo;s Stone.&rsquo;-SCOTT. See also

The royalists remarked that he was killed by a shot fired from St. Chad&rsquo;s
Cathedral, and upon St. Chad&rsquo;s day, and received his death-wound
in the very eye with which, he had said, he hoped to see the ruin of
all the cathedrals in England. The magnificent church in question suffered

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Drink, weary pilgrim, drink and
stay,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rest by the well of Sybil Grey.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<b>Stanza XXXVIII</b>. In this stanza the poet indicates the spirit
in which romances are written, clearly indicating that those only that
have ears will be able to hear. <i>&lsquo;Phonanta sunetoisin&rsquo;</i>
might be the watchword of all imaginative writers. Cp. Thackeray&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Rebecca and Rowena.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<b>line 1155</b>. Hall and Holinshed were chroniclers of the sixteenth
century, to both of whom Shakespeare was indebted for pliant material.<br>
<br>
<b>line 1168</b>. Sir Thomas More, Lord Sands, and Anthony Denny. See
Henry VIII.<br>
<br>
<b>lines 1169-70</b>. The references are to old homely customs at weddings.
See Brand&rsquo;s &lsquo;Popular Antiquities.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<b>L&rsquo;ENVOY</b>.<br>
<br>
Scott&rsquo;s fondness for archaisms makes him add his L&rsquo;Envoy
in the manner of early English and Scottish poets. See e.g. Spenser&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Shepherd&rsquo;s Calendar&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Phoenix&rsquo;
of James VI.<br>
<br>
<b>line 4</b>. Rede, &lsquo;used generally for <i>tale</i> or <i>discourse</i>.&rsquo;-SCOTT.<br>
<br>
<b>line 6</b>. Cp. William Morris&rsquo;s introduction to &lsquo;Earthly
Paradise,&rsquo; where the poet calls himself<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;The idle singer of an empty day.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<b>line 17</b>. This hearty wish is uttered, no doubt, with certain
reminiscences of the author&rsquo;s own school days. His youthful spirit,
and his genial sympathy with the young, are prominent features in the
character of Sir Walter Scott.<br>

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

Or /etext03, 02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):

disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").

without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it

copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
